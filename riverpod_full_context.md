title: Migrating from 2.0 to 3.0
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { AutoSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";

For the list of changes, please refer to the [What's new in Riverpod 3.0](whats_new) page.

Riverpod 3.0 introduces a number of breaking changes that may require you to update your code.
They should in general be relatively minor, but we recommend you to read this page carefully.

:::info
This migration is supposed to be smooth.  
If there is anything that is unclear, or if you encountered a scenario that is difficult
to migrate, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/issues/new/choose).

It is important to us that the migration is as smooth as possible, so we will do our best to help you, 
improve the migration guide, or even include helpers to make the migration easier.
:::

## Automatic retry

Riverpod 3.0 now [automatically retries](./whats_new.mdx#automatic-retry) failing providers by default.
This means that if a provider fails to compute its value, it will automatically retry until it succeeds.

In general, this is a good thing as it makes your app more resilient to transient errors.
However, you may want to disable/customize this behavior in some cases.

To disable automatic retry globally, you can do so on `ProviderContainer`/`ProviderScope`:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ProviderScope" label="ProviderScope" defaultValue>

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ProviderScope(
      // Never retry any provider
      retry: (retryCount, error) => null,
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ProviderContainer" label="ProviderContainer" defaultValue>

```dart
void main() {
  final container = ProviderContainer(
    // Never retry any provider
    retry: (retryCount, error) => null,
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can disable automatic retry on a per-provider basis by using the `retry` parameter of the provider:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  // Never retry this specific provider
  Duration? retry(int retryCount, Object error) => null;
  
  @Riverpod(retry: retry)
  class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
    @override
    List<Todo> build() => [];
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  final todoListProvider = NotifierProvider<TodoList, List<Todo>>(
    TodoList.new,
    // Never retry this specific provider
    retry: (retryCount, error) => null,
  );
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

## Out of view providers are paused

In Riverpod 3.0, [out of view providers are paused by default](./whats_new.mdx#listeners-inside-widgets-that-are-not-visible-are-now-paused).

There is currently no way to disable this behavior globally, but you can control
the pause behavior at the consumer level by using the [TickerMode] widget.

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TickerMode(
      enabled: true, // Never pause any descendant listener.
      child: Consumer(
        builder: (context, ref, child) {
          // This "watch" will not follow the automatic pausing behavior
          // until TickerMode is removed.
          final value = ref.watch(myProvider);
          return Text(value.toString());
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

## StateProvider, StateNotifierProvider, and ChangeNotifierProvider are moved to a new import

In Riverpod 3.0, `StateProvider`, `StateNotifierProvider`, and `ChangeNotifierProvider` are considered "legacy".  
They are not removed, but are no longer part of the main API. This is to discourage their use
in favor of the new `Notifier` API.

To keep using them, you need to change your imports to one of the following:

```dart
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/legacy.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/legacy.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/legacy.dart';
```

## Providers now all use == to filter updates

Before, Riverpod was inconsistent in how it filtered updates to providers.
Some providers used `==` to filter updates, while others used `identical`.
In Riverpod 3.0, [all providers now use `==` to filter updates](./whats_new.mdx#all-updateshouldnotify-now-use-).

The most likely way for you to be impacted by this change is when using
[StreamProvider]/[StreamNotifier], as now stream values will be filtered by `==`.
If you need to, you can override `Notifier.updateShouldNotify` to customize the behavior.

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
    @override
    Stream<Todo> build() => Stream(...);
  
    @override
    bool updateShouldNotify(AsyncValue<Todo> previous, AsyncValue<Todo> next) {
      // Custom implementation
      return true;
    }
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  class TodoList extends StreamNotifier<Todo> {
    @override
    Stream<Todo> build() => Stream(...);
  
    @override
    bool updateShouldNotify(AsyncValue<Todo> previous, AsyncValue<Todo> next) {
      // Custom implementation
      return true;
    }
  }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>


In the scenario where you didn't use a `Notifier`, you can refactor your provider in its notifier equivalent
(Such as converting [StreamProvider] to [StreamNotifierProvider]).


## ProviderObserver has its interface slightly changed

For the sake of [mutations](./whats_new.mdx#mutations), 
the [ProviderObserver] interface has changed slightly.

Instead of two separate parameters for [ProviderContainer] and [ProviderBase], 
a single `ProviderObserverContext` object is passed.
This object contains both the container, provider, and extra information (such as the associated mutation).

To migrate, you need to update all methods of your observers like so:

```diff
class MyObserver extends ProviderObserver {
  @override
-  void didAddProvider(ProviderBase provider, Object? value, ProviderContainer container) {
+  void didAddProvider(ProviderObserverContext context, Object? value) {
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Simplified Ref and removed Ref subclasses

For the sake of simplification, [Ref] has lost its type parameter, and all properties/methods that were
using the type parameter have been moved to [Notifier]s.  

Specifically, `ProviderRef.state`, `Ref.listenSelf` and `FutureProviderRef.future` should be replaced by
`Notifier.state`, `Notifier.listenSelf` and `AsyncNotifier.future` respectively.

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  // Before:
  @riverpod
  Future<int> value(ValueRef ref) async {
    ref.listen(anotherProvider, (previous, next) {
      ref.state++;
    });
    
    ref.listenSelf((previous, next) {
      print('Log: $previous -> $next');
    });
    
    ref.future.then((value) {
      print('Future: $value');
    });
  
    return 0;
  }
  
  // After
  @riverpod
  class Value extends _$Value {
    @override
    Future<int> build() async {
      ref.listen(anotherProvider, (previous, next) {
        ref.state++;
      });
    
      listenSelf((previous, next) {
        print('Log: $previous -> $next');
      });
    
      future.then((value) {
        print('Future: $value');
      });
    
      return 0;
    }
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  // Before:
  final valueProvider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) async {
    ref.listen(anotherProvider, (previous, next) {
      ref.state++;
    });
    
    ref.listenSelf((previous, next) {
      print('Log: $previous -> $next');
    });
    
    ref.future.then((value) {
      print('Future: $value');
    });
  
    return 0;
  });
  
  // After
  class Value extends AsyncNotifier<int> {
    @override
    Future<int> build() async {
      ref.listen(anotherProvider, (previous, next) {
        ref.state++;
      });
    
      listenSelf((previous, next) {
        print('Log: $previous -> $next');
      });
    
      future.then((value) {
        print('Future: $value');
      });
    
      return 0;
    }
  }
  final valueProvider = AsyncNotifierProvider<Value, int>(Value.new);
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

Similarly, all [Ref] subclasses are removed (such as but not limited to `ProviderRef`, `FutureProviderRef`, etc).

This primarily affects code-generation. Instead of `MyProviderRef`, you can now use `Ref` directly:

```diff
@riverpod
-int example(ExampleRef ref) {
+int example(Ref ref) {
  // ...
}
```

## AutoDispose interfaces are removed.

The auto-dispose feature is simplified. Instead of relying on a clone of all interfaces,
interfaces are unified. In short, instead of `AutoDisposeProvider`, `AutoDisposeNotifier`, 
etc, you now have `Provider`, `Notifier`, etc. The behavior is the same, but the API is simplified.

To easily migrate, you can do a case-sensitive replace of `AutoDispose` to ` ` (empty string).

## The family variant of Notifiers is removed

In the same vein as the previous point, the family variant of Notifiers has been removed.
Now, we only use `Notifier`/`AsyncNotifier`/`StreamNotifier`, and `FamilyNotifier`/... have been removed.

To migrate, you will need to replace:
- `FamilyNotifier` -> `Notifier`
- `FamilyAsyncNotifier` -> `AsyncNotifier`
- `FamilyStreamNotifier` -> `StreamNotifier`

Then, you will need to:
- Remove the parameter from the `build` method
- Add a constructor on your Notifier

An example of this migration is as follows:

```diff
final provider = NotifierProvider.family<CounterNotifier, int, String>(CounterNotifier.new);

-class CounterNotifier extends FamilyNotifier<int, String> {
+class CounterNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
+  CounterNotifier(this.arg);
+  final String arg;

   @override
-  int build(String arg) {
+  int build() {
     // Use `arg` as needed
      return 0;
   }
}
```

## Provider failures are now rethrown as ProviderExceptions

In Riverpod 3.0, all provider failures are [rethrown as `ProviderException`s](./whats_new.mdx#when-reading-a-provider-results-in-an-exception-the-error-is-now-wrapped-in-a-providerexception). 
This means that if a provider fails to compute its value, reading it will throw a `ProviderException` instead of the original error.

This can impact you if you were relying on the original error type to handle specific errors.
To migrate, you can catch the `ProviderException` and extract the original error from it:

```diff
try {
  await ref.read(myProvider.future);
-} on NotFoundException {
-  // Handle NotFoundException
+} on ProviderException catch (e) {
+  if (e.exception is NotFoundException) {
+    // Handle NotFoundException
+  }
}
```

:::info
This is only necessary if you were explicitly relying on try/catch to handle such error.

If you are using [AsyncValue] to check for errors, you don't need to change anything:

```dart
AsyncValue<int> value = ref.watch(myProvider);
if (value.error is NotFoundException) {
  // Handle NotFoundException
  // This still works today
}
```

- [Statically safe scoping](#statically-safe-scoping-code-generation-only) - New lint rules are added to detect when an override is missing

## Offline persistence (experimental)

:::info
This feature is experimental and not yet stable.
It is usable, but the API may change in breaking ways without a major version bump.
:::

Offline persistence is a new feature that enables caching a provider locally on the device.
Then, when the application is closed and reopened, the provider can be restored from the cache.  
Offline persistence is opt-in, and supported by all "Notifier" providers,
and regardless of if you use code generation or not.

Riverpod only includes interfaces to interact with a database. It does not include a database itself.
You can use any database you want, as long as it implements the interfaces.  
An official package for SQLite is maintained: [riverpod_sqflite](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_sqflite).

As a short demo, here's how you can use offline persistence:  

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
    @riverpod
    Future<JsonSqFliteStorage> storage(Ref ref) async {
      // Initialize SQFlite. We should share the Storage instance between providers.
      return JsonSqFliteStorage.open(
        join(await getDatabasesPath(), 'riverpod.db'),
      );
    }
    
    /// A serializable Todo class. We're using Freezed for simple serialization.
    @freezed
    abstract class Todo with _$Todo {
      const factory Todo({
        required int id,
        required String description,
        required bool completed,
      }) = _Todo;
    
      factory Todo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$TodoFromJson(json);
    }
    
    @riverpod
    @JsonPersist()
    class TodosNotifier extends _$TodosNotifier {
      @override
      FutureOr<List<Todo>> build() async {
        // We call persist at the start of our 'build' method.
        // This will:
        // - Read the DB and update the state with the persisted value the first
        //   time this method executes.
        // - Listen to changes on this provider and write those changes to the DB.
        persist(
          // We pass our JsonSqFliteStorage instance. No need to "await" the Future.
          // Riverpod will take care of that.
          ref.watch(storageProvider.future),
          // By default, state is cached offline only for 2 days.
          // We can optionally uncomment the following line to change cache duration.
          // options: const StorageOptions(cacheTime: StorageCacheTime.unsafe_forever),
        );
  
        // We asynchronously fetch todos from the server.
        // During the await, the persisted todo list will be available.
        // After the network request completes, the server state will take precedence
        // over the persisted state.
        final todos = await fetchTodos();
        return todos;
      }
  
      Future<void> add(Todo todo) async {
        // When modifying the state, no need for any extra logic to persist the change.
        // Riverpod will automatically cache the new state and write it to the DB.
        state = AsyncData([...await future, todo]);
      }
    }

      state = AsyncData([...await future, todo]);
    }
  }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>


## Mutations (experimental)

:::info
This feature is experimental and not yet stable.
It is usable, but the API may change in breaking ways without a major version bump.
:::

A new feature called "mutations" is introduced in Riverpod 3.0.  
This feature solves two problems:
- It empowers the UI to react to "side-effects" (such as form submissions, button clicks, etc),
  to enable it to show loading/success/error messages.
  Think "Show a toast when a form is submitted successfully".
- It solves an issue where `onPressed` callbacks combined with [Ref.read] and <Link documentID="concepts2/auto_dispose" />
  could cause providers to be disposed while a side-effect is still in progress.

The TL;DR is, a new [Mutation] object is added. It is declared as a top-level final variable,
like providers:

```dart
final addTodoMutation = Mutation<void>();
```

After that, your UI can use `ref.listen`/`ref.watch` to listen to the state of mutations:

```dart
class AddTodoButton extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    // Listen to the status of the "addTodo" side-effect
    final addTodo = ref.watch(addTodoMutation);

    return switch (addTodo) {
      // No side-effect is in progress
      // Let's show a submit button
      MutationIdle() => ElevatedButton(
        // Trigger the side-effect on click
        onPressed: () {
          // TODO see explanation after the code snippet
        },
        child: const Text('Submit'),
      ),
      // The side-effect is in progress. We show a spinner
      MutationPending() => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      // The side-effect failed. We show a retry button
      MutationError() => ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // TODO see explanation after the code snippet
        },
        child: const Text('Retry'),
      ),
      // The side-effect was successful. We show a success message
      MutationSuccess() => const Text('Todo added!'),
    };
  }
}
```

Last but not least, inside our `onPressed` callback, we can trigger our side-effect as
followed:

```dart
onPressed: () {
  addTodoMutation.run(ref, (tsx) async {
    // This is where we run our side-effect.
    // Here, we typically obtain a Notifier and call a method on it.
    await tsx.get(todoListProvider.notifier).addTodo('New Todo');
  });
}
```

:::note
Note how we called [tsx.get] here instead of [Ref.read].  
This is a feature unique to mutations. That [tsx.get] obtains the state of a provider,
but keep it alive until the mutation is completed.
:::


## Automatic retry

Starting 3.0, providers that fail during initialization will automatically retry.
The retry is done with an exponential backoff, and the provider will be retried
until it succeeds or is disposed. This helps when an operation fails due to a temporary issue, such as a lack of network connection.

The default behavior retries any error, and starts with a 200ms delay that
doubles after each retry up to 6.4 seconds.  
This can be customized for all providers on [ProviderContainer]/[ProviderScope] by passing a `retry` parameter:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="ProviderScope" label="ProviderScope" defaultValue>

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ProviderScope(
      // You can customize the retry logic, such as to skip
      // specific errors or add a limit to the number of retries
      // or change the delay
      retry: (retryCount, error) {
        if (error is SomeSpecificError) return null;
        if (retryCount > 5) return null;

        return Duration(seconds: retryCount * 2);
      },
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ProviderContainer" label="ProviderContainer" defaultValue>

```dart
void main() {
  final container = ProviderContainer(
    // You can customize the retry logic, such as to skip
    // specific errors or add a limit to the number of retries
    // or change the delay
    retry: (retryCount, error) {
      if (error is SomeSpecificError) return null;
      if (retryCount > 5) return null;

      return Duration(seconds: retryCount * 2);
    },
  );
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Alternatively, this can be configured on a per-provider basis by passing a `retry` parameter to the provider constructor:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  Duration retry(int retryCount, Object error) {
    if (error is SomeSpecificError) return null;
    if (retryCount > 5) return null;
  
    return Duration(seconds: retryCount * 2);
  }
  
  @Riverpod(retry: retry)
  class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
    @override
    List<Todo> build() => [];
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  final todoListProvider = NotifierProvider<TodoList, List<Todo>>(
    TodoList.new,
    retry: (retryCount, error) {
      if (error is SomeSpecificError) return null;
      if (retryCount > 5) return null;
    
      return Duration(seconds: retryCount * 2);
    },
  );
  `}
></AutoSnippet>


## `Ref.mounted`

The long-awaited `Ref.mounted` is finally here! It is similar to `BuildContext.mounted`, but for `Ref`.

You can use it to check if a provider is still mounted after an async operation:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
    @override
    List<Todo> build() => [];
    
    Future<void> addTodo(String title) async {
      // Post the new todo to the server
      final newTodo = await api.addTodo(title);
      // Check if the provider is still mounted
      // after the async operation
      if (!ref.mounted) return;
    
      // If it is, update the state
      state = [...state, newTodo];
    }
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  class TodoList extends Notifier<List<Todo>> {
    @override
    List<Todo> build() => [];
    
    Future<void> addTodo(String title) async {
      // Post the new todo to the server
      final newTodo = await api.addTodo(title);
      // Check if the provider is still mounted
      // after the async operation
      if (!ref.mounted) return;
    
      // If it is, update the state
      state = [...state, newTodo];
    }
  }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

For this to work, quite a few life-cycle changes were necessary.  
Make sure to read the [life-cycle changes](#provider-life-cycle-changes) section.

## Generic support (code-generation)

When using code generation, you can now define type parameters for your generated providers.
Type parameters work like any other provider parameter, and need to be passed
when watching the provider.

```dart
@riverpod
T multiply<T extends num>(T a, T b) {
  return a * b;
}

// ...

int integer = ref.watch(multiplyProvider<int>(2, 3));
double decimal = ref.watch(multiplyProvider<double>(2.5, 3.5));
```

## Pause/Resume support

In 2.0, Riverpod already had some form of pause/resume support, but it was fairly limited.
With 3.0, all `ref.listen` listeners can be manually paused/resumed on demand:

```dart
final subscription = ref.listen(
  todoListProvider,
  (previous, next) {
    // Do something with the new value
  },
);

subscription.pause();
subscription.resume();
```

At the same time, Riverpod now pauses providers in various situations:
- When a provider is no-longer visible, it is paused
  (Based off [TickerMode]).
- When a provider rebuilds, its subscriptions are paused until the rebuild completes.
- When a provider is paused, all of its subscriptions are paused too.

See the [life-cycle changes](#provider-life-cycle-changes) section for more details.

## Unification of the Public APIs

One goal of Riverpod 3.0 is to simplify the API. This includes:
- Highlighting what is recommended and what is not
- Removing needless interface duplicates
- Making sure all functionalities function in a consistent way

For this sake, a few changes were made:

### [StateProvider]/[StateNotifierProvider] and [ChangeNotifierProvider] are discouraged and moved to a different import

Those providers are not removed, but simply moved to a different import.
Instead of:

```dart
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';
```
You should now use:
```dart
import 'package:riverpod/legacy.dart';
```

This is to highlight that those providers are not recommended anymore.  
At the same time, those are preserved for backward compatibility.

### AutoDispose interfaces are removed

No, the "auto-dispose" feature isn't removed. This only concerns the interfaces.
In 2.0, all providers, Refs and Notifiers were duplicated for the sake of auto-dispose (
`Ref` vs `AutoDisposeRef`, `Notifier` vs `AutoDisposeNotifier`, etc).
This was done for the sake of having a compilation error in some edge-cases, but came
at the cost of a worse API.

In 3.0, the interfaces are unified, and the previous compilation error is now implemented
as a lint rule (using [riverpod_lint]). 
What this means concretely is that you can replace all references to
`AutoDisposeNotifier` with `Notifier`. The behavior of your code should not change.

```diff
final provider = NotifierProvider.autoDispose<MyNotifier, int>(
  MyNotifier.new,
);

- class MyNotifier extends AutoDisposeNotifier<int> {
+ class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
}
```

### "FamilyNotifier" and "Notifier" are fused

Similarly to the previous point, the `FamilyNotifier` and `Notifier` interfaces
are now fused.

Long story short, instead of:

```dart
final provider = NotifierProvider.family<CounterNotifier, int, Argument>(
  MyNotifier.new,
);

class CounterNotifier extends FamilyNotifier<int, Argument> {
  @override
  int build(Argument arg) => 0;
}
```

We now do:

```dart
final provider = NotifierProvider.family<CounterNotifier, int, Argument>(
  CounterNotifier.new,
);

class CounterNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  CounterNotifier(this.arg);
  final Argument arg;
  @override
  int build() => 0;
}
```

This means that instead of `Notifier`+`FamilyNotifier`+`AutoDisposeNotifier`+`AutoDisposeFamilyNotifier`,
we always use the `Notifier` class.

This change has no impact on code-generation.

### One `Ref` to rule them all

In Riverpod 2.0, each provider came with its own [Ref] subclass (`FutureProviderRef`, `StreamProviderRef`, etc).  
Some `Ref` had `state` property, some a `future`, or a `notifier`, etc. 
Although useful, this was a lot of complexity for not much gain. One of the reasons
for that is because [Notifier]s already have the extra properties it had,
so the interfaces were redundant.

In 3.0, `Ref` is unified. No more generic parameter such as `Ref<T>`,
no more `FutureProviderRef`. We only have one thing: `Ref`.
What this means in practice is, the syntax for generated providers is simplified:

```diff
-Example example(ExampleRef ref) {
+Example example(Ref ref) {
  return Example();
}
```


:::info
This does not concern [WidgetRef], which is intact.  
[Ref] and [WidgetRef] are two different things.
:::

### All `updateShouldNotify` now use `==`

`updateShouldNotify` is a method that is used to determine if a provider should
notify its listeners when a state change occurs. 
But in 2.0, the implementation of this method varied quite a bit between providers.
Some providers used `==`, some `identical`, and some more complex logic.

Starting 3.0, all providers use `==` to filter notifications.

This can impact you in a few ways:
- Some of your providers may not notify their listeners anymore
  in certain situations.
- Some listeners may be notified more often than before.
- If you have a large data class that overrides `==`, you may see a small
  performance impact.

The most common case where you will be impacted is when using [StreamProvider]/[StreamNotifier],
as events of the stream are now filtered using `==`.

If you are impacted by those changes, you can override `updateShouldNotify` to
use a custom implementation:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
    @override
    Stream<Todo> build() => Stream(...);
  
    @override
    bool updateShouldNotify(AsyncValue<Todo> previous, AsyncValue<Todo> next) {
      // Custom implementation
      return true;
    }
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  class TodoList extends StreamNotifier<Todo> {
    @override
    Stream<Todo> build() => Stream(...);
  
    @override
    bool updateShouldNotify(AsyncValue<Todo> previous, AsyncValue<Todo> next) {
      // Custom implementation
      return true;
    }
  }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

## Provider life-cycle changes

### Refs and Notifiers can no-longer be interacted with after they have been disposed

In 2.0, in some edge-cases you could still interact with things like [Ref] or [Notifier]
after they were disposed. This was not intended and caused various severe bugs.

In 3.0, Riverpod will throw an error if you try to interact with a disposed Ref/Notifier.

You can use [Ref.mounted] to check if a Ref/Notifier is still usable.

```dart
final provider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  // Abort the provider if it has been disposed during the await.
  // You can throw whatever you want and ignore this exception in your error reporting tools.
  if (!ref.mounted) throw MyException();
  return 42;
});
```

### When reading a provider results in an exception, the error is now wrapped in a ProviderException

Before, if a provider threw an error, Riverpod would sometimes rethrow that error directly:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  Future<int> example(Ref ref) async {
    throw StateError('Error');
  }
  
  // ...
  ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () async {
      // This will rethrow the StateError
      ref.read(exampleProvider).requireValue;
    
      // This also rethrows the StateError
      await ref.read(exampleProvider.future);
    },
    child: Text('Click me'),
  );
  `}
  
  raw={`
  final exampleProvider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) async {
    throw StateError('Error');
  });
  
  // ...
  ElevatedButton(
    onPressed: () async {
      // This will rethrow the StateError
      ref.read(exampleProvider).requireValue;
    
      // This also rethrows the StateError
      await ref.read(exampleProvider.future);
    },
    child: Text('Click me'),
  );
  `}
></AutoSnippet>


In 3.0, this is changed. Instead, the error will be encapsulated in a `ProviderException`
that contains both the original error and its stack trace.

:::info
`AsyncValue.error`, `ref.listen(..., onError: ...)` and [ProviderObserver]s  are unaffected by this change,
and will still receive the unaltered error.
:::

This has multiple benefits:
- Debugging is improved, as we have a much better stack trace
- It is now possible to determine if a provider failed, or
  if it is in error state because it depends on another provider that failed.

For example, a [ProviderObserver] can use this to avoid logging the same error twice:

```dart
class MyObserver extends ProviderObserver {
  @override
  void providerDidFail(ProviderObserverContext context, Object error, StackTrace stackTrace) {
    if (error is ProviderException) {
      // The provider didn't fail directly, but instead depends on a failed provider.
      // The error was therefore already logged.
      return;
    }

    // Log the error
    print('Provider failed: $error');
  }
}
```

This is used internally by Riverpod in its automatic retry mechanism. The default automatic retry
ignores `ProviderException`s:

```dart
ProviderContainer(
  // Example of the default retry behavior
  retry: (retryCount, error) {
    if (error is ProviderException) return null;

    // ...
  },
);
```

### Listeners inside widgets that are not visible are now paused

Now that Riverpod has a way to [pause listeners](#pauseresume-support), Riverpod uses that to
natively pauses listeners when the widget is not visible. In practice what this means is: Providers that are not used by the visible widget tree
are paused.

As a concrete example, consider an application with two routes:
- A home page, listening to a websocket using a provider
- A settings page, which does not rely on that websocket


In typical applications, a user first opens the home page _and then_ opens the settings page.
This means that while the settings page is open, the homepage is also open, but not visible.

In 2.0, the homepage would actively keep listening to the websocket.  
In 3.0, the websocket provider will instead be paused, possibly saving resources.

**How it works:**  
Riverpod relies on [TickerMode] to determine if a widget is visible or not. And when
false, all listeners of a [Consumer] are paused.

It also means that you can rely on [TickerMode] yourself to manually control
the pause behavior of your consumers. You can voluntarily set the value to true/false
to forcibly resume/pause listeners:

```dart
class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TickerMode(
      enabled: false, // This will pause the listeners
      child: Consumer(
        builder: (context, ref, child) {
          // This "watch" will be paused
          // until TickerMode is set to true
          final value = ref.watch(myProvider);
          return Text(value.toString());
        },
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### If a provider is only used by paused providers, it is paused too

Riverpod 2.0 already had some form of pause/resume support. But it was limited and failed 
to cover some edge-cases.  
Consider:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  int example(Ref ref) {
    ref.keepAlive();
    ref.onCancel(() => print('paused'));
    ref.onResume(() => print('resumed'));
    return 0;
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  final exampleProvider = Provider<int>((ref) {
    ref.onCancel(() => print('paused'));
    ref.onResume(() => print('resumed'));
    return 0;
  });
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

In 2.0, if you were to call `ref.read` once on this provider,
the state of the provider would be maintained, but 'paused' will be printed. This is because
calling `ref.read` does not "listen" to the provider. And since the provider is not "listened"
to, it is paused.

This is useful to pause providers that are currently not used! 
The problem is that in many cases, this optimization does not work.  
For example, your provider could be used indirectly through another provider.

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  int another(Ref ref) {
    ref.keepAlive();
    return ref.watch(exampleProvider);
  }
  
  class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
      return Button(
        onPressed: () {
          ref.read(anotherProvider);
        },
        child: Text('Click me'),
      );
    }
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  final anotherProvider = Provider<int>((ref) {
    return ref.watch(exampleProvider);
  });
   
   class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
      return Button(
        onPressed: () {
          ref.read(anotherProvider);
        },
        child: Text('Click me'),
      );
    }
  }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

In this scenario, if we click on the button once,
then `anotherProvider` will start listening to our `exampleProvider`. But `anotherProvider`
is no-longer used and will be paused. Yet `exampleProvider` will not be paused,
because it thinks that it is still being used.  
As such, clicking on the button will not print 'paused' anymore. 

In 3.0, this is fixed. If a provider is only used by paused providers, it is paused too.

### When a provider rebuilds, its previous subscriptions now are kept until the rebuild completes

In 2.0, there was a known inconvenience when using asynchronous providers
combined with 'auto-dispose'.

Specifically, when an asynchronous provider watches an auto-dispose provider
after an `await`, the "auto dispose" could be triggered unexpectedly.

Consider:  
<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  Stream<int> autoDispose(Ref ref) {
    ref.onDispose(() => print('disposed'));
    ref.onCancel(() => print('paused'));
    ref.onResume(() => print('resumed'));
    // A stream that emits a value every second
    return Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (i) => i);
  }
  
  @riverpod
  Future<int> asynchronousExample(Ref ref) async {
    print('Before async gap');
    // An async gap inside a provider ; typically an API call.
    // This will dispose the "autoDispose" provider
    // before the async operation is completed
    await null;
    
    print('after async gap');
    // We listen to our auto-dispose provider
    // after the async operation
    return ref.watch(autoDisposeProvider.future);
  }
  
  void main() {
    final container = ProviderContainer();
    // This will print 'disposed' every second,
    // and will constantly print 0
    container.listen(asynchronousExampleProvider, (_, value) {
      if (value is AsyncData) print('\${value.value}\\n----');
    });
  }
  `}
  
  raw={`
  final autoDisposeProvider = StreamProvider.autoDispose<int>((ref) {
    ref.onDispose(() => print('disposed'));
    ref.onCancel(() => print('paused'));
    ref.onResume(() => print('resumed'));
    // A stream that emits a value every second
    return Stream.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (i) => i);
  });
  
  final asynchronousExampleProvider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) async {
    print('Before async gap');
    // An async gap inside a provider ; typically an API call.
    // This will dispose the "autoDispose" provider
    // before the async operation is completed
    await null;
    
    print('after async gap');
    // We listen to our auto-dispose provider
    // after the async operation
    return ref.watch(autoDisposeProvider.future);
  });
  
  void main() {
    final container = ProviderContainer();
    // This will print 'disposed' every second,
    // and will constantly print 0
    container.listen(asynchronousExampleProvider, (_, value) {
      if (value is AsyncData) print('\${value.value}\\n----');
    });
  }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

In you run this on [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/), you will see that its prints:

```
// First print
Before async gap
after async gap
0
---- // Second and after prints
paused
Before async gap
disposed // The 'autoDispose' provider was disposed during the async gap!
after async gap
0
----
paused
Before async gap
disposed
after async gap
0
----
... // And so on every second
```

As you can see, this consistently prints `0` every second,
because the `autoDispose` provider repeatedly gets disposed during the async gap. 
A workaround was to move the `ref.watch` call before the `await` statement.
But this is error prone, not very intuitive, and not always possible.

In 3.0, this is fixed by delaying the disposal of listeners.  
When a provider rebuilds, instead of immediately removing all of its listeners,
it [pauses](#pauseresume-support) them.

The exact same code will now instead print:

```
// First print
Before async gap
after async gap
0
----
paused
Before async gap
after async gap
resumed
1
----
paused
Before async gap
after async gap
resumed
2
----
... // And so on every second
```

### Exceptions in providers are rethrown as a `ProviderException`.

For the sake of differentiating between "a provider failed" from "a provider is depending on a failed provider",
Riverpod 3.0 now wraps exceptions in a `ProviderException` that contains the original.

This means that if you catch errors in your providers, you will need to update your try/catch to inspect
the content of `ProviderException`:

```dart
try {
  ref.watch(failingProvider);
} on ProviderException catch (e) {
  switch (e.exception) {
    case SomeSpecificError():
      // Handle the specific error
    default:
      // Handle other errors
      rethrow;
  }
}
```

## New testing utilities

### `ProviderContainer.test`

In 2.0, typical testing code would rely on a custom-made utility called `createContainer`.  
In 3.0, this utility is now part of Riverpod, and is called `ProviderContainer.test`.
It creates a new container, and automatically disposes it after the test ends.

```dart
void main() {
  test('My test', () {
    final container = ProviderContainer.test();
    // Use the container
    // ...
    // The container is automatically disposed after the test ends
  });
}
```

You can safely do a global search-and-replace for `createContainer` to `ProviderContainer.test`.

### `NotifierProvider.overrideWithBuild`

It is now possible to mock only the `Notifier.build` method, without mocking the whole notifier.
This is useful when you want to initialize your notifier with a specific state, but still want to
use the original implementation of the notifier.

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
    @riverpod
    class MyNotifier extends _$MyNotifier {
      @override
      int build() => 0;
    
      void increment() {
        state++;
      }
    }
    
    void main() {
      final container = ProviderContainer.test(
        overrides: [
          myProvider.overrideWithBuild((ref) {
            // Mock the build method to start at 42.
            // The "increment" method is unaffected.
            return 42;
          }),
        ],
      );
    }
  `}
  
  raw={`
    class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
      @override
      int build() => 0;
    
      void increment() {
        state++;
      }
    }
    
    final myProvider = NotifierProvider<MyNotifier, int>(MyNotifier.new);
    
    void main() {
      final container = ProviderContainer.test(
        overrides: [
          myProvider.overrideWithBuild((ref) {
            // Mock the build method to start at 42.
            // The "increment" method is unaffected.
            return 42;
          }),
        ],
      );
    }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

### `Future/StreamProvider.overrideWithValue`

A while back, `FutureProvider.overrideWithValue` and `StreamProvider.overrideWithValue`
were removed "temporarily" from Riverpod.  
They are finally back!

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
    @riverpod
    Future<int> myFutureProvider() async {
      return 42;
    }
    
    void main() {
      final container = ProviderContainer.test(
        overrides: [
          // Initializes the provider with a value.
          // Changing the override will update the value.
          myFutureProvider.overrideWithValue(AsyncValue.data(42)),
        ],
      );
    }
  `}
  
  raw={`
    final myFutureProvider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) async {
      return 42;
    });
    
    void main() {
      final container = ProviderContainer.test(
        overrides: [
          // Initializes the provider with a value.
          // Changing the override will update the value.
          myFutureProvider.overrideWithValue(AsyncValue.data(42)),
        ],
      );
    }
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

### `WidgetTester.container`

A simple way to access the `ProviderContainer` in your widget tree.

```dart
void main() {
  testWidgets('can access a ProviderContainer', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(const ProviderScope(child: MyWidget()));
    ProviderContainer container = tester.container();
  });
}
```

See the [WidgetTester.container] extension for more information.

## Custom ProviderListenables

It is now possible to create custom [ProviderListenable]s in Riverpod 3.0.
This is doable using [SyncProviderTransformerMixin].

The following example implements a variable of `provider.select`,
where the callback returns a boolean instead of the selected value.

```dart
final class Where<T> with SyncProviderTransformerMixin<T, T> {
  Where(this.source, this.where);
  @override
  final ProviderListenable<T> source;
  final bool Function(T previous, T value) where;

  @override
  ProviderTransformer<T, T> transform(
    ProviderTransformerContext<T, T> context,
  ) {
     return ProviderTransformer(
       initState: (_) => context.sourceState.requireValue,
       listener: (self, previous, next) {
         if (where(previous, next))
           self.state = next;
       },
     );
  }
}

extension<T> on ProviderListenable<T> {
  ProviderListenable<T> where(
    bool Function(T previous, T value) where,
  ) => Where<T>(this, where);
}
```

Used as `ref.watch(provider.where((previous, value) => value > 0))`.

## Statically safe scoping (code-generation only)

Through [riverpod_lint], Riverpod now includes a way to detect when scoping is used incorrectly.
This lints detects when an override is missing, to avoid runtime errors.

Consider:

```dart
// A typical "scoped provider"
@Riverpod(dependencies: [])
Future<int> myFutureProvider() => throw UnimplementedError();
```

To use this provider, you have two options.  
If neither of the following options are used, the provider will throw an error at runtime.

- Override the provider using `ProviderScope` before using it:
  ```dart
  class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ProviderScope(
        overrides: [
          myFutureProvider.overrideWithValue(AsyncValue.data(42)),
        ],
        // A consumer is necessary to access the overridden provider
        child: Consumer(
          builder: (context, ref, child) {
            // Use the provider
            final value = ref.watch(myFutureProvider);
            return Text(value.toString());
          },
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  ```
- Specify `@Dependencies` on whatever uses the scoped provider to indicate that it 
  depends on it.
  ```dart
  @Dependencies([myFuture])
  class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
      // Use the provider
      final value = ref.watch(myFutureProvider);
      return Text(value.toString());
    }
  }
  ```
  After specifying `@Dependencies`, all usages of `MyWidget` will
  require the same two options as above:
  - Either override the provider using `ProviderScope` before using `MyWidget`
    ```dart
    void main() {
      runApp(
        ProviderScope(
          overrides: [
            myFutureProvider.overrideWithValue(AsyncValue.data(42)),
          ],
          child: MyWidget(),
        ),
      );
    }
    ```
  - Or specify `@Dependencies` on whatever uses `MyWidget` to indicate that it depends on it.
    ```dart
    @Dependencies([myFuture])
    class MyApp extends ConsumerWidget {
      @override
      Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
         // MyApp indirectly uses scoped providers through MyWidget
         return MyWidget();
      }
    }
    ```

## Other changes

### AsyncValue

[AsyncValue] received various changes.

* It is now "sealed". This enables exhaustive pattern matching:
  ```dart
  AsyncValue<int> value;
  switch (value) {
    case AsyncData():
      print('data');
    case AsyncError():
      print('error');
    case AsyncLoading():
      print('loading');
    // No default case needed
  }
  ```
* `valueOrNull` has been renamed to `value`.
  The old `value` is removed, as its behavior related to errors
  was odd.
  To migrate, do a global search-and-replace of `valueOrNull` -> `value`.
* `AsyncValue.isFromCache` has been added.  
  This flag is set when a value is obtained through offline persistence.
  It enables your UI to differentiate state coming from the database
  and state from the server.
* An optional `progress` property is available on `AsyncLoading`.
  This enables your providers to define the current progress for a
  request:
  <AutoSnippet
    language="dart"
    codegen={`
      @riverpod
      class MyNotifier extends _$MyNotifier {
        @override
        Future<User> build() async {
          // You can optionally pass a "progress" to AsyncLoading
          state = AsyncLoading(progress: .0);
          await fetchSomething();
          state = AsyncLoading(progress: 0.5);
          
          return User();
        }
      }
    `}
    
    raw={`
      class MyNotifier extends AsyncNotifier<User> {
        @override
        Future<User> build() async {
          // You can optionally pass a "progress" to AsyncLoading
          state = AsyncLoading(progress: .0);
          await fetchSomething();
          state = AsyncLoading(progress: 0.5);
        
          return User();
        }
      }
    `}
  ></AutoSnippet>

### All Ref listeners now return a way to remove the listener

It is now possible to "unsubscribe" to the various life-cycles listeners:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
    @riverpod
    Future<int> example(Ref ref) {
      // onDispose and other life-cycle listeners return a function
      // to remove the listener.
      final removeListener = ref.onDispose(() => print('dispose));
      // Simply call the function to remove the listener:
      removeListener();
      
      // ...
    }
  `}
  
  raw={`
    final exampleProvider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) {
      // onDispose and other life-cycle listeners return a function
      // to remove the listener.
      final removeListener = ref.onDispose(() => print('dispose));
      // Simply call the function to remove the listener:
      removeListener();
       
      // ...
    });
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

### Weak listeners - listen to a provider without preventing auto-dispose.

When using `Ref.listen`, you can optionally specify `weak: true`:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
    @riverpod
    Future<int> example(Ref ref) {
      ref.listen(
        anotherProvider,
        // Specify the flag
        weak: true,
        (previous, next) {},
      );
      
      // ...
    }
  `}
  
  raw={`
    final exampleProvider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) {
      ref.listen(
        anotherProvider,
        // Specify the flag
        weak: true,
        (previous, next) {},
      );
      
      // ...
    });
  `}
></AutoSnippet>

Specifying this flag will tell Riverpod that it can still dispose
the listened provider if it stops being used.

This flag is an advanced feature to help with some niche use-cases
regarding combining multiple "sources of truth" in a single provider.

version: 2

import family from "./family";
import {
  AutoSnippet,
} from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";


This article recaps the differences and the similarities between Provider and Riverpod.

## Defining providers

The primary difference between both packages is how "providers" are defined.

With [Provider], providers are widgets and as such placed inside the widget tree,
typically inside a `MultiProvider`:

```dart
class Counter extends ChangeNotifier {
 ...
}

void main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider<Counter>(create: (context) => Counter()),
      ],
      child: MyApp(),
    )
  );
}
```

With Riverpod, providers are **not** widgets. Instead they are plain Dart objects.  
Similarly, providers are defined outside of the widget tree, and instead are declared
as global final variables.

Also, for Riverpod to work, it is necessary to add a `ProviderScope` widget above the
entire application. As such, the equivalent of the Provider example using Riverpod
would be:

```dart
// Providers are now top-level variables
final counterProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<Counter>((ref) => Counter());

void main() {
  runApp(
    // This widget enables Riverpod for the entire project
    ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

Notice how the provider definition simply moved up a few lines.

:::info
Since with Riverpod providers are plain Dart objects, it is possible to use
Riverpod without Flutter.  
For example, Riverpod can be used to write command line applications.
:::

## Reading providers: BuildContext

With Provider, one way of reading providers is to use a Widget's `BuildContext`.

For example, if a provider was defined as:

```dart
Provider<Model>(...);
```

then reading it using [Provider] is done with:

```dart
class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    Model model = context.watch<Model>();

  }
}
```

The equivalent in Riverpod would be:

```dart
final modelProvider = Provider<Model>(...);

class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    Model model = ref.watch(modelProvider);

  }
}
```

Notice how:

- Riverpod's snippet extends `ConsumerWidget` instead of `StatelessWidget`.
  That different widget type adds one extra parameter to our `build` function:
  `WidgetRef`.

- Instead of `BuildContext.watch`, in Riverpod we do `WidgetRef.watch`, using
  the `WidgetRef` which we obtained from `ConsumerWidget`.

- Riverpod does not rely on generic types. Instead it relies on the variable
  created using provider definition.

Notice too how similar the wording is. Both Provider and Riverpod use the keyword
"watch" to describe "this widget should rebuild when the value changes".

:::info
Riverpod uses the same terminology as Provider for reading providers.

- `BuildContext.watch` -> `WidgetRef.watch`
- `BuildContext.read` -> `WidgetRef.read`
- `BuildContext.select` -> `WidgetRef.watch(myProvider.select)`

The rules for `context.watch` vs `context.read` applies to Riverpod too:  
Inside the `build` method, use "watch". Inside click handlers and other events,
use "read". When in need of filtering out values and rebuilds, use "select".
:::

## Reading providers: Consumer

Provider optionally comes with a widget named `Consumer` (and variants such as `Consumer2`)
for reading providers.

`Consumer` is helpful as a performance optimization, by allowing more granular rebuilds
of the widget tree - updating only the relevant widgets when the state changes:

As such, if a provider was defined as:

```dart
Provider<Model>(...);
```

Provider allows reading that provider using `Consumer` with:

```dart
Consumer<Model>(
  builder: (BuildContext context, Model model, Widget? child) {

  }
)
```

Riverpod has the same principle. Riverpod, too, has a widget named `Consumer`
for the exact same purpose.

If we defined a provider as:

```dart
final modelProvider = Provider<Model>(...);
```

Then using `Consumer` we could do:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref, Widget? child) {
    Model model = ref.watch(modelProvider);

  }
)
```

Notice how `Consumer` gives us a `WidgetRef` object. This is the same object
as we saw in the previous part related to `ConsumerWidget`.

### There is no `ConsumerN` equivalent in Riverpod

Notice how pkg:Provider's `Consumer2`, `Consumer3` and such aren't needed nor missed in Riverpod.

With Riverpod, if you want to read values from multiple providers, you can simply write multiple `ref.watch` statements,
like so:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    Model1 model = ref.watch(model1Provider);
    Model2 model = ref.watch(model2Provider);
    Model3 model = ref.watch(model3Provider);
    // ...
  }
)
```

When compared to pkg:Provider's `ConsumerN` APIs, the above solution feels way less heavy and it should be easier to understand.

## Combining providers: ProxyProvider with stateless objects

When using Provider, the official way of combining providers is using the
`ProxyProvider` widget (or variants such as `ProxyProvider2`).

For example we may define:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(create: (context) => UserIdNotifier()),
```

From there we have two options. We may combine `UserIdNotifier` to create a new
"stateless" provider (typically an immutable value that possibly override ==).
Such as:

```dart
ProxyProvider<UserIdNotifier, String>(
  update: (context, userIdNotifier, _) {
    return 'The user ID of the user is ${userIdNotifier.userId}';
  }
)
```

This provider would automatically return a new `String` whenever
`UserIdNotifier.userId` changes.

We can do something similar in Riverpod, but the syntax is different.  
First, in Riverpod, the definition of our `UserIdNotifier` would be:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

final userIdNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(
  (ref) => UserIdNotifier(),
);
```

From there, to generate our `String` based on the `userId`, we could do:

```dart
final labelProvider = Provider<String>((ref) {
  UserIdNotifier userIdNotifier = ref.watch(userIdNotifierProvider);
  return 'The user ID of the user is ${userIdNotifier.userId}';
});
```

Notice the line doing `ref.watch(userIdNotifierProvider)`.

This line of code tells Riverpod to obtain the content of the `userIdNotifierProvider`
and that whenever that value changes, `labelProvider` will be recomputed too.
As such, the `String` emitted by our `labelProvider` will automatically update
whenever the `userId` changes.

This `ref.watch` line should feel similar. This pattern was covered previously
when explaining [how to read providers inside widgets](#reading-providers-buildcontext).
Indeed, providers are now able to listen to other providers in the same way
that widgets do.

## Combining providers: ProxyProvider with stateful objects

When combining providers, another alternative use-case is to expose
stateful objects, such as a `ChangeNotifier` instance.

For that, we could use `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` (or variants such as `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider2`).  
For example we may define:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(create: (context) => UserIdNotifier()),
```

Then, we can define a new `ChangeNotifier` that is based on `UserIdNotifier.userId`.
For example we could do:

```dart
class UserNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? _userId;

  void setUserId(String? userId) {
    if (userId != _userId) {
      print('The user ID changed from $_userId to $userId');
      _userId = userId;
    }
  }
}

// ...

ChangeNotifierProxyProvider<UserIdNotifier, UserNotifier>(
  create: (context) => UserNotifier(),
  update: (context, userIdNotifier, userNotifier) {
    return userNotifier!
      ..setUserId(userIdNotifier.userId);
  },
);
```

This new provider creates a single instance of `UserNotifier` (which is never re-constructed)
and prints a string whenever the user ID changes.

Doing the same thing in provider is achieved differently.
First, in Riverpod, the definition of our `UserIdNotifier` would be:

```dart
class UserIdNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? userId;
}

// ...

final userIdNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserIdNotifier>(
  (ref) => UserIdNotifier(),
),
```

From there, the equivalent to the previous `ChangeNotifierProxyProvider` would be:

```dart
class UserNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  String? _userId;

  void setUserId(String? userId) {
    if (userId != _userId) {
      print('The user ID changed from $_userId to $userId');
      _userId = userId;
    }
  }
}

// ...

final userNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<UserNotifier>((ref) {
  final userNotifier = UserNotifier();
  ref.listen<UserIdNotifier>(
    userIdNotifierProvider,
    (previous, next) {
      if (previous?.userId != next.userId) {
        userNotifier.setUserId(next.userId);
      }
    },
  );

  return userNotifier;
});
```

The core of this snippet is the `ref.listen` line.  
This `ref.listen` function is a utility that allows listening to a provider,
and whenever the provider changes, executes a function.

The `previous` and `next` parameters of that function correspond to the
last value before the provider changed and the new value after it changed.

## Scoping Providers vs `.family` + `.autoDispose`
In pkg:Provider, scoping was used for two things:
  - destroying state when leaving a page
  - having custom state per page

Using scoping just to destroy state isn't ideal.  
The problem is that scoping doesn't work well over large applications.  
For example, state often is created in one page, but destroyed later in a different page after navigation.  
This doesn't allow for multiple caches to be active over different pages.

Similarly, the "custom state per page" approach quickly becomes difficult to handle if that state 
needs to be shared with another part of the widget tree, 
like you'd need with modals or a with a multi-step form.

Riverpod takes a different approach: first, scoping providers is kind-of discouraged; second, 
`.family` and `.autoDispose` are a complete replacement solution for this.

Within Riverpod, Providers marked as `.autoDispose` automatically destroy their state when they aren't used anymore.  
When the last widget removing a provider is unmounted, Riverpod will detect this and destroy the provider.  
Try using these two lifecycle methods in a provider to test this behavior:

```dart
ref.onCancel((){
  print("No one listens to me anymore!");
});
ref.onDispose((){
  print("If I've been defined as `.autoDispose`, I just got disposed!");
});
```

This inherently solves the "destroying state" problem.

Also it is possible to mark a Provider as `.family` (and, at the same time, as `.autoDispose`).  
This enables passing parameters to providers, which make multiple providers to be spawned and tracked internally.  
In other words, when passing parameters, *a unique state is created per unique parameter*.

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...family}></AutoSnippet>


This solves the "custom state per page" problem. Actually, there's another advantage: such state is no-longer bound to one specific page.  
Instead, if a different page tries to access the same state, such page will be able to do so by just reusing the parameters.
 
In many ways, passing parameters to providers is equivalent to a Map key.  
If the key is the same, the value obtained is the same. If it's a different key, a different state will be obtained.

---
title: Quickstart
version: 2
---

This section is designed for people familiar with the [Provider] package who
wants to learn about Riverpod.

Before anything, read the short [getting started] article and try out the small
[sandbox] example to test Riverpod's features out. If you like what you see there, you should then
definitively consider a migration.

Indeed, migrating from Provider to Riverpod can be very straightforward.  

Migrating basically consists in a few steps that can be done in an *incremental* way.

## Start with `ChangeNotifierProvider`

It's fine to keep using `ChangeNotifier` while transitioning towards Riverpod,
and not use its latest fancy features ASAP.
  
Indeed, the following is perfectly fine to start with:

```dart
// If you have this...
class MyNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  int state = 0;

  void increment() {
    state++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// ... just add this!
final myNotifierProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<MyNotifier>((ref) {
  return MyNotifier();
});
```

As you can see Riverpod exposes a [ChangeNotifierProvider] class,
which is there precisely to support migrations from pkg:Provider.

Keep in mind that this provider is not recommended when writing new code,
and it is not the best way to use Riverpod, but it's a gentle and very easy way to start your migration.

:::tip
There is no rush to *immediately* try to change your `ChangeNotifier`s into the more modern [Notifiers].
Some require a bit of a paradigm shift, so it may be difficult to do initially.  

Take your time, as it is important to get yourself familiar with Riverpod first;
you'll quickly find out that *almost* all Providers from pkg:provider have a strict equivalent in pkg:riverpod.
:::

## Start with *leaves*

Start with Providers that do not depend on anything else, i.e. start with the *leaves* in your dependency tree.  
Once you have migrated all of the leaves, you can then move on to the providers that depend on leaves.

In other words, avoid migrating `ProxyProvider`s at first; tackle them once all of their dependencies have been migrated.

This should boost and simplify the migration process, while also minimizing / tracking down any errors.


## Riverpod and Provider can coexist
*Keep in mind that it is entirely possible to use both Provider and Riverpod at the same time.*

Indeed, using import aliases, it is possible to use the two APIs altogether.  
This is also great for readability and it removes any ambiguous API usage.

If you plan on doing this, consider using import aliases for each Provider import in your codebase.

:::info
A full guide onto how to effectively implement import aliases is incoming soon.
:::

## Migrate one Provider at a time

If you have an existing app, don't try to migrate all your providers at once!

While you should strive toward moving all your application to Riverpod in the long-run, 
**don't burn yourself out**.  
Do it one provider at a time.  

Take the above example. **Fully** migrating that `myNotifierProvider` to Riverpod means writing the following:

```dart
class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() => 0;

  void increment() => state++;
}

final myNotifierProvider = NotifierProvider<MyNotifier, int>(MyNotifier.new);
```

.. and it's _also_ needed to change how that provider is consumed, i.e. writing `ref.watch` in the place of each `context.watch` for this provider.

This operation might take some time and might lead to some errors, so don't rush doing this all at once.

## Migrating `ProxyProvider`s
Within pkg:Provider, `ProxyProvider` is used to combine values from other Providers;
its build depends on the value of other providers, reactively.

With Riverpod, instead, Providers [are composable by default]; therefore, when migrating a `ProxyProvider`
you'll simply need to write `ref.watch` if you want to declare a direct dependency from a Provider to another.

If anything, combining values with Riverpod should feel simpler and straightforward; thus, the migration should greatly
simplify your code.

Furthermore, there are no shenanigans about combining more than two providers together:
just add another `ref.watch` and you'll be good to go.

## Eager initialization

Since Notifiers are final global variables, they are lazy by default.

If you need to initialize some warm-up data or a useful service on startup,
the best way to do it is to first read your provider in the place where you used to put `MultiProvider`.

In other words, since Riverpod can't be forced to be eager initialized, they can be read and cached
in your startup phase, so that they're warm and ready when needed inside the rest of your application.

A full guide about eager initialization of pkg:Notifiers [is available here].

## Code Generation
[Code generation] is recommended to use Riverpod the *future-proof* way.  
As a side note, chances are that when metaprogramming will be a thing, codegen will be default for Riverpod.

Unluckily, `@riverpod` can't generate code for `ChangeNotifierProvider`.  
To overcome this, you can use the following utility extension method:
```dart
extension ChangeNotifierWithCodeGenExtension on Ref {
  T listenAndDisposeChangeNotifier<T extends ChangeNotifier>(T notifier) {
    notifier.addListener(notifyListeners);
    onDispose(() => notifier.removeListener(notifyListeners));
    onDispose(notifier.dispose);
    return notifier;
  }
}
```

And then, you can expose your `ChangeNotifier` with the following codegen syntax:
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unsupported_provider_value
@riverpod
MyNotifier example(Ref ref) {
  return ref.listenAndDisposeChangeNotifier(MyNotifier());
}
```

Once the "base" migration is done, you can change your `ChangeNotifier` to `Notifier`,
thus eliminating the need for temporary extensions.  
Taking up the previous examples, a "fully migrated" `Notifier` becomes:

```dart
@riverpod
class MyNotifier extends _$MyNotifier {
  @override
  int build() => 0;

  void increment() => state++;
}
```

Once this is done, and you're positive that there are no more `ChangeNotifierProvider`s 
in your codebase, you can get rid of the temporary extension definitively.

Keep in mind that, while being recommended, codegen is not *mandatory*.  
It's good to reason about migrations incrementally:
if you feel like that implementing this migration *while* transitioning to
the code generation syntax in one single take might be too much, *that's fine*.

Following this guide, you *can* migrate towards codegen as a further step forward, later on.

  - Can I migrate incrementally?
  - etc.

By the end of this section you should be convinced that Riverpod is to be preferred over Provider.

**Riverpod is indeed a more modern, recommended and reliable approach when compared to Provider**.

Riverpod offers better State Management capabilities, better Caching strategies and a simplified Reactivity model.
Whereas, Provider is currently lacking in many areas with no way forward.

## Provider's Limitations

Provider has fundamental issues due to being restricted by the InheritedWidget API.  
Inherently, Provider is a "simpler `InheritedWidget`"; 
Provider is merely an InheritedWidget wrapper, and thus it's limited by it.

Here's a list of known Provider issues.

### Provider can't keep two (or more) providers of the same "type"
Declaring two `Provider<Item>` will result into unreliable behavior: `InheritedWidget`'s API will 
obtain only *one of the two*: the closest `Provider<Item>` ancestor.  
While a [workaround] is explained in Provider's 
documentation, Riverpod simply doesn't have this problem.

By removing this limitation, we can freely split logic into tiny pieces, like so:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...sameType}></AutoSnippet>


### Providers reasonably emit only one value at a time
When reading an external RESTful API, it's quite common to show 
the last read value, while a new call loads the next one.  
Riverpod allows this behavior via emitting two values at a time (i.e. a previous data value, 
and an incoming new loading value), via its `AsyncValue`'s APIs:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...asyncValues}></AutoSnippet>

In the previous snippet, watching `evenItemsProvider` will produce the following effects:
1. Initially, the request is being made. We obtain an empty list;
2. Then, say an error occurs. We obtain `[Item(id: -1)]`;
3. Then, we retry the request with a pull-to-refresh logic (e.g. via `ref.invalidate`);
4. While we reload the first provider, the second one still exposes `[Item(id: -1)]`;
5. This time, some parsed data is received correctly: our even items are correctly returned.

With Provider, the above features aren't remotely achievable, and even less easy to workaround.

### Combining providers is hard and error-prone
With Provider we may be tempted to use `context.watch` inside provider's `create`.  
This would be unreliable, as `didChangeDependencies` may be triggered even if no dependency 
has changed (e.g. such as when there's a GlobalKey involved in the widget tree).

Nonetheless, Provider has an ad-hoc solution named `ProxyProvider`, but it's considered tedious and error-prone.

Combining state is a core Riverpod mechanism, as we can combine and cache values reactively with zero overhead 
with simple yet powerful utilities such as [ref.watch] and [ref.listen]:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...combine}></AutoSnippet>

Combining values feels natural with Riverpod: dependencies are readable and the APIs remain the same.


### Lack of safety
With Provider, it's common to end-up with a `ProviderNotFoundException` during refactors and / or during large changes.  
Indeed, this runtime exception *was* one of the main reasons Riverpod was created in the first place.

Although it brings much more utility than this, Riverpod simply can't throw this exception.

### Disposing of state is difficult
`InheritedWidget` [can't react when a consumer stops listening to them].  
This prevents the ability for Provider 
to automatically destroy its providers' state when they're no-longer used.  
With Provider, [we have to] rely on scoping providers to dispose the state when it stops being used.  
But this isn't easy, as it gets tricky when state is shared between pages.

Riverpod solves this with easy-to-understand APIs such as [autodispose] and [Ref.keepAlive].  
These two APIs enable flexible and creative caching strategies (e.g. time-based caching):

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...autoDispose}></AutoSnippet>


Unluckily, there's no way to implement this with a raw `InheritedWidget`, and thus with Provider.

### Lack of a reliable parametrization mechanism
Riverpod allows its user to declare "parametrized" Providers with the [.family modifier].  
Indeed, `.family` is one of Riverpod's most powerful feature and it is core to its innovations, 
e.g. it enables enormous simplification of logic. 

If we wanted to implement something similar using Provider, we would have to give 
up easiness of use *and* type-safeness on such parameters. 

Furthermore, not being able to implement a similar `.autoDispose` mechanism with Provider 
inherently prevents any equivalent implementation of `.family`, as these two features go hand-in-hand.

Finally, as shown before, [it turns out] that widgets *never* stop to listen to an `InheritedWidget`.  
This implies significant memory leaks if some provider state is "dynamically mounted", i.e. when using parameters 
to a build a Provider, which is exactly what `.family` does.  
Thus, obtaining a `.family` equivalent for Provider is fundamentally impossible at the moment in time.

### Testing is tedious
To be able to write a test, you *have to* re-define providers inside each test.

With Riverpod, providers are ready to use inside tests, by default. Furthermore, Riverpod exposes a 
handy collection of "overriding" utilities that are crucial when mocking Providers.

Testing the combined state snippet above would be as simple as the following:

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...override}></AutoSnippet>

### Triggering side effects isn't straightforward
Since `InheritedWidget` has no `onChange` callback, Provider can't have one.  
This is problematic for navigation, such as for snackbars, modals, etc.  

Instead, Riverpod simply offers [ref.listen], which integrates well with Flutter.

<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...sideEffects}></AutoSnippet>

## Towards Riverpod

Conceptually, Riverpod and Provider are fairly similar.
Both packages fill a similar role. Both try to:

- cache and dispose some stateful objects;
- offer a way to mock those objects during tests;
- offer a way for Widgets to listen to those objects in a simple way.

You can think of Riverpod as what Provider could've been if it continued to mature for a few years.

### Why a separate package?
Originally, a major version of Provider was planned to ship, as a way to solve 
the aforementioned problems.  
But it was then decided against it, as this would have been 
"too breaking" and even controversial, because of the new `ConsumerWidget` API.  
Since Provider is still one of the most used Flutter packages, it was instead decided 
to create a separate package, and thus Riverpod was created.

Creating a separate package enabled:
  - Ease of migration for whoever wants to, by also enabling the temporary use of both approaches, *at the same time*;
  - Allow folks to stick to Provider if they dislike Riverpod in principle, or if they didn't find it reliable yet;
  - Experimentation, allowing for Riverpod to search for production-ready solutions to the various Provider's technical limitations.

Indeed, Riverpod is designed to be the spiritual successor of Provider. Hence the name "Riverpod" (which is an anagram of "Provider").

### The breaking change
The only true downside of Riverpod is that it requires changing the widget type to work:

- Instead of extending `StatelessWidget`, with Riverpod you should extend `ConsumerWidget`.
- Instead of extending `StatefulWidget`, with Riverpod you should extend `ConsumerStatefulWidget`.

But this inconvenience is fairly minor in the grand scheme of things. And this requirement might, one day, disappear.

### Choosing the right library
You're probably asking yourself: 
*"So, as a Provider user, should I use Provider or Riverpod?"*.

We want to answer to this question very clearly:

    You probably should be using Riverpod

Riverpod is overall better designed and could lead to drastic simplifications of your logic.

==================================================
FILE: concepts2/consumers.mdx
==================================================

---
title: Consumers
---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";

A "Consumer" is a type of widget that bridges the gap between the Widget tree and the Provider tree.

The only real difference between a Consumer and typical widgets is that Consumers
get access to a [Ref]. This enables them to read providers and listen to their changes.
See <Link documentID="concepts2/refs" /> for more information.

Consumers come in a few different flavors, mostly for personal preference. You will find:
- [Consumer], a "builder" widget (similar to [FutureBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html)).
  It allows widgets to interact with providers without having to subclass something other than `StatelessWidget` or `StatefulWidget`.
  ```dart
  // We subclass StatelessWidget as usual
  class MyWidget extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      // A FutureBuilder-like widget
      return Consumer(
        // The "builder" callback gives us a "ref" parameter
        builder: (context, ref, _) {
          // We can use that "ref" to listen to providers
          final value = ref.watch(myProvider);
          return Text(value.toString());
        },
      );
    }
  }
  ```
- [ConsumerWidget], a variant of `StatelessWidget` widget.
  Instead of subclassing `StatelessWidget`, you subclass `ConsumerWidget`. It will behave the same,
  besides the fact that `build` receives an extra [WidgetRef] parameter.
  ```dart
  // We subclass ConsumerWidget instead of StatelessWidget
  class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
    // "build" receives an extra parameter
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
      // We can use that "ref" to listen to providers
      final value = ref.watch(myProvider);
      return Text(value.toString());
    }
  }
  ```
- [ConsumerStatefulWidget], a variant of `StatefulWidget` widget.  
  Again, instead of subclassing `StatefulWidget`, you subclass `ConsumerStatefulWidget`.
  And instead of `State`, you subclass [ConsumerState].
  The unique part is that [ConsumerState] has a `ref` property.
  ```dart
  // We subclass ConsumerStatefulWidget instead of StatefulWidget
  class MyWidget extends ConsumerStatefulWidget {
    @override
    ConsumerState<MyWidget> createState() => _MyWidgetState();
  }
  // We subclass ConsumerState instead of State
  class _MyWidgetState extends ConsumerState<MyWidget> {
    // A "this.ref" property is available
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      // We can use that "ref" to listen to providers
      final value = ref.watch(myProvider);
      return Text(value.toString());
    }
  }
  ```

Alternatively, you will find extra consumers in the [hooks_riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/hooks_riverpod) package.
Those combine Riverpod consumers with [flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks).
If you don't care about hooks, you can ignore them.


### Which one to use?

The choice of which consumer to use is mostly a matter of personal preference.
You could use [Consumer] for everything. It is a slightly more verbose option than the others.
But this is a reasonable price to pay if you do not like how Riverpod hijacks `StatelessWidget` and `StatefulWidget`.

But if you do not have a strong opinion, we recommend using [ConsumerWidget] (or [ConsumerStatefulWidget] when you need a `State`).

### Why can't we use `StatelessWidget` + `context.watch`?

In alternative packages like [provider](https://pub.dev/packages/provider), you can use `context.watch` to listen to providers.
This works inside any widget, as long as you have a `BuildContext`. So why isn't this the case in Riverpod?

The reason is that relying purely on `BuildContext` instead of a [Ref] would prevent the implementation
of Riverpod's <Link documentID="concepts2/auto_dispose" /> in a reliable way. There _are_ tricks to make
an implementation that "mostly works" with `BuildContext`.
The problem is that there are lots of subtle edge-cases which could silently break the auto-dispose feature.

This would cause memory leaks, but that's not the real issue.  
Automatic disposal is more importantly about stopping the execution of code that is no longer needed.
If auto-dispose fails to dispose a provider, then that provider may continuously perform
network requests in the background.

Riverpod preferred to not compromise on reliability for the sake of a little convenience.

:::note
To alleviate the downsides of having to use [ConsumerWidget]/[ConsumerStatefulWidget] instead of `StatelessWidget`/`StatefulWidget`,
Riverpod offers various refactors in IDEs like VSCode and Android Studio.

title: Offline persistence (experimental)
---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import {
  AutoSnippet,
} from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import storage from './offline/storage'
import manualPersist from './offline/manual_persist'
import destroyKey from './offline/destroy_key';
import waitPersist from 'raw-loader!./offline/wait_persist.dart';
import jsonPersist from 'raw-loader!./offline/json_persist.dart'
import customDuration from 'raw-loader!./offline/custom_duration.dart';
import inMemoryTest from 'raw-loader!./offline/in_memory_test.dart';

Offline persistence is the ability to store the state of <Link documentID="concepts2/providers" />
on the user's device, so that it can be accessed even when the user is offline or when the app is restarted.

Riverpod is independent from the underlying database or the protocol used to store the data.
But by default, Riverpod provides [riverpod_sqflite] alongside basic JSON serialization.

:::caution
Riverpod's offline persistence is designed to be a simple wrapper around
databases. It is not designed to fully replace code for interacting with a database.

You may still need to manually interact with a database for:
- Advanced Database migrations
- More optimized storage strategies
- Unusual use-cases
:::


Offline persistence works using two parts:
1. [Storage], an interface to interact with your database.
  This is typically implemented by a package (such as [riverpod_sqflite]).
1. [AnyNotifier.persist], a function used inside notifiers to opt-in to persistence.

## Creating a Storage

Before we start persisting notifiers, we need to instantiate an object that implements the
[Storage] interface. This object will be responsible for connecting Riverpod with your database.

You need have to either:
- Download a package that provides a way to connect Riverpod with your Database of choice.
- Manually implement [Storage]

If using SQFlite, you can use [riverpod_sqflite]:

```sh
dart pub add riverpod_sqflite sqflite
```

Then, you can create a Storage by instantiating [JsonSqFliteStorage]:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/experimental/persist.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:path/path.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_sqflite/riverpod_sqflite.dart';
import 'package:sqflite/sqflite.dart';

final storageProvider = FutureProvider<Storage<String, String>>((ref) async {
  // Initialize SQFlite. We should share the Storage instance between providers.
  return JsonSqFliteStorage.open(
    join(await getDatabasesPath(), 'riverpod.db'),
  );
});

```


## Persisting the state of a provider

Once we've created a [Storage], we can start persisting the state of providers.  
Currently, only "Notifiers" can be persisted. See <Link documentID="concepts2/providers" /> for more information about them.

To persist the state of a notifier, you will typically need to call [AnyNotifier.persist] inside the `build` method of your notifier.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async, avoid_dynamic_calls

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/experimental/persist.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import '../storage/codegen.dart';

Future<List<Todo>> fetchTodosFromServer() async => [];

/* SNIPPET START */
class Todo {
  Todo({required this.task});
  final String task;
}

final todoListProvider = AsyncNotifierProvider<TodoList, List<Todo>>(
  TodoList.new,
);

class TodoList extends AsyncNotifier<List<Todo>> {
  @override
  Future<List<Todo>> build() async {
    persist(
      // We pass in the previously created Storage.
      // Do not "await" this. Riverpod will handle it for you.
      ref.watch(storageProvider.future),
      // A unique identifier for this state.
      // If your provider receives parameters, make sure to encode those
      // in the key as well.
      key: 'todo_list',
      // Encode/decode the state. Here, we're using a basic JSON encoding.
      // You can use any encoding you want, as long as your Storage supports it.
      encode: (todos) => todos.map((todo) => {'task': todo.task}).toList(),
      decode:
          (json) =>
              (json as List)
                  .map((todo) => Todo(task: todo['task'] as String))
                  .toList(),
    );

    // Regardless of whether some state was restored or not, we fetch the list of
    // todos from the server.
    return fetchTodosFromServer();
  }
}

```


### Using simplified JSON serialization (code-generation)

If you are using [riverpod_sqflite] and code-generation, you can simplify the `persist` call
by using the [JsonPersist] annotation:


> **Snippet: json_persist.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/experimental/persist.dart';
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/experimental/json_persist.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

import 'storage/codegen.dart';

part 'json_persist.g.dart';
part 'json_persist.freezed.dart';

Future<List<Todo>> fetchTodosFromServer() async => [];

/* SNIPPET START */
// Using freezed or json_serializable to generate from/toJson for your objects
@freezed
abstract class Todo with _$Todo {
  const factory Todo({required String task}) = _Todo;

  factory Todo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$TodoFromJson(json);
}

@riverpod
// Specify @JsonPersist. This will provide a custom "persist" method for your notifier
@JsonPersist()
class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
  @override
  Future<List<Todo>> build() async {
    persist(
      // We pass in the previously created Storage.
      // Do not "await" this. Riverpod will handle it for you.
      ref.watch(storageProvider.future),
      // No need to specify key/encode/decode functions.
    );

    // Initialize the notifier as usual.
    return fetchTodosFromServer();
  }
}

```


## Understanding persist keys

In some of the previous snippets, we've passed a `key` parameter to [AnyNotifier.persist]. 
That key is there to enable your database to know where to store the state of a provider in the Database.
Depending on the database, this key may be a unique row ID.

When specifying `key`, it is critical to ensure that:
- The key is unique across all providers that you persist.  
  Failing to do so could cause data corruption, as two providers could be trying to write
  to the same row in the database. If Riverpod detects two providers using the same key, an assertion will be thrown.
- The key is stable across app restarts.
  If the key changes, Riverpod will not be able to restore the state of the provider
  when the app is restarted, and the provider will be initialized as if it was never persisted
- The key needs to include any parameter that the provider takes.
  When using "families" (cf <Link documentID="concepts2/family" />), the key needs to include the family parameter.


## Changing the cache duration

By default, state is only cached for 2 days. This default ensures that
no leak happens and deleted providers stay in the database indefinitely

This is generally safe, as Riverpod is designed to be used primarily
as a cache for IO operations (network requests, database queries, etc).
But such default will not be suitable for all use-cases, such as if
you want to store user preferences.

To change this default, specify `options` like so:


> **Snippet: custom_duration.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/experimental/persist.dart';
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/experimental/json_persist.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

import 'storage/codegen.dart';

part 'custom_duration.g.dart';
part 'custom_duration.freezed.dart';

@freezed
abstract class Todo with _$Todo {
  const factory Todo({
    required String id,
    required String title,
    required bool completed,
  }) = _Todo;

  factory Todo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$TodoFromJson(json);
}

Future<List<Todo>> fetchTodosFromServer() async => [];

@riverpod
@JsonPersist()
class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
  /* SNIPPET START */
  @override
  Future<List<Todo>> build() async {
    persist(
      ref.watch(storageProvider.future),
      // We tell Riverpod to forever persist the state of this provider.
      // highlight-next-line
      options: const StorageOptions(
        // Instead of "unsafe_forever", you can alternatively specify a Duration.
        cacheTime: StorageCacheTime.unsafe_forever,
      ),
      // ...
    );

    return fetchTodosFromServer();
  }

  /* SNIPPET END */
}

```


:::caution
If you set the cache duration to infinite, make sure to
manually delete the persisted state from the database if you ever delete the provider.

For this, refer to your database's documentation.
:::


## Using "destroy key" for simple data-migration

A common challenge when persisting data is handling when the data structure changes.
If you change how an object is serialized, you may need to migrate the data stored in the database.

While Riverpod does not provide a way to do proper data migration, it does provide a way to
easily replace the old persisted state with a brand new one: Destroy keys.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async, avoid_dynamic_calls

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/experimental/persist.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import '../storage/codegen.dart';

Future<List<Todo>> fetchTodosFromServer() async => [];

class Todo {
  Todo({required this.task});
  final String task;
}

final todoListProvider = AsyncNotifierProvider<TodoList, List<Todo>>(
  TodoList.new,
);

/* SNIPPET START */
class TodoList extends AsyncNotifier<List<Todo>> {
  @override
  Future<List<Todo>> build() async {
    persist(
      ref.watch(storageProvider.future),
      // We can optionally pass a "destroyKey". When a new version of the application
      // is release with a different destroyKey, the old persisted state will be
      // deleted, and a brand new state will be created.
      // highlight-next-line
      options: const StorageOptions(destroyKey: '1.0'),
      // Persist as usual
      key: 'todo_list',
      encode: (todos) => todos.map((todo) => {'task': todo.task}).toList(),
      decode:
          (json) =>
              (json as List)
                  .map((todo) => Todo(task: todo['task'] as String))
                  .toList(),
    );

    return fetchTodosFromServer();
  }
}

```


Destroy keys help doing simple data migrations by enabling Riverpod to know when
the old persisted state should be discarded. When a new version of the application
is released with a different destroyKey, the old persisted state will be discarded,
and the provider will be initialized as if it was never persisted.

## Waiting for persistence decoding

Until now, we've never waited for [AnyNotifier.persist] to complete.  
This is voluntary, as this allows the provider to start its network requests as soon as possible.
However, it means that the provider cannot easily access the persisted state
right after calling `persist`.

In some cases, instead of initializing the provider with a network request,
you may want to initialize it with the persisted state.

In that case, you can await the result of `persist` as follows:

```dart
await persist(...).future;
```

This enables accessing the persisted state within `build` using `this.state`:


> **Snippet: wait_persist.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/experimental/persist.dart';
import 'package:freezed_annotation/freezed_annotation.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/experimental/json_persist.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

import 'storage/codegen.dart';

part 'wait_persist.g.dart';
part 'wait_persist.freezed.dart';

Future<List<Todo>> fetchTodosFromServer() async => [];

@freezed
abstract class Todo with _$Todo {
  const factory Todo({
    required String id,
    required String title,
    required bool completed,
  }) = _Todo;

  factory Todo.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) => _$TodoFromJson(json);
}

@riverpod
@JsonPersist()
class TodoList extends _$TodoList {
  /* SNIPPET START */
  @override
  Future<List<Todo>> build() async {
    // Wait for decoding to complete
    await persist(
      ref.watch(storageProvider.future),
      // ...
    ).future;

    // If any state has been decoded, initialize the provider with it.
    // Otherwise provide a default value.
    return state.value ?? <Todo>[];
  }
  /* SNIPPET END */
}

```


## Testing persistence

When testing your application, it may be inconvenient to use a real database.
In particular, unit and widget tests will not have access to a device,
and thus cannot use a database.

For this reason, Riverpod provides a way to use an in-memory database using [Storage.inMemory].  
To have your test use this in-memory database, you can use <Link documentID="concepts2/overrides" />:


> **Snippet: in_memory_test.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: invalid_use_of_visible_for_testing_member, unused_local_variable

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/experimental/persist.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

import 'storage/codegen.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => const Placeholder();
}

void main() {
  /* SNIPPET START */
  testWidgets('Widget test example', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      ProviderScope(
        overrides: [
          // Override the `storageProvider` so that our application
          // uses an in-memory storage.
          storageProvider.overrideWith((ref) {
            // Create an in-memory storage.
            final storage = Storage<String, String>.inMemory();
            // Initialize it with some data.
            storage.write(
              'todo_list',
              '{"task": "Eat a cookie"}',
              const StorageOptions(),
            );

            return storage;
          }),
        ],
        child: const MyApp(),
      ),
    );
  });

  test('Pure dart example', () {
    final container = ProviderContainer.test(
      // Same as above, we override the `storageProvider`
      overrides: [
        storageProvider.overrideWith(
          (ref) => Storage<String, String>.inMemory(),
        ),
      ],
    );

    // TODO use container to interact with providers by hand.
  });
  /* SNIPPET END */
}

```

title: Scoping providers
---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import { AutoSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import usage from './scoping/usage';
import dependencies from './scoping/dependencies';
import override from 'raw-loader!./scoping/override.dart';

Scoping is the act of changing the behavior of a provider for only a small part of your application.

This is useful for:
- Page/Widget-specific customization (e.g changing the theme of your app for one specific page)
- Performance optimization (e.g rebuilding only the item that changes in a `ListView`)
- Avoiding having to pass parameters around (such as for <Link documentID="concepts2/family" />)

Scoping is achieved using <Link documentID="concepts2/overrides" />, by 
overriding a provider in <Link documentID="concepts2/containers" /> that are _not_ the root of your application.

:::caution
The scoping feature is highly complex and will likely be
reworked in the future to be more ergonomic.  

Thread carefully.
:::


## Defining a scoped provider

By default, Riverpod will not allow you to scope a provider. You need to opt-in to this feature by
specifying `dependencies` on the provider.

The first scoped provider in your app will typically specify `dependencies: []`.  
The following snippet defines a scoped provider that exposes the current item ID that is being displayed:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class User {
  User();

  factory User.fromJson(_) => User();
}

/* SNIPPET START */
final currentItemIdProvider = Provider<String?>(
  // highlight-next-line
  dependencies: const [],
  (ref) => null,
);

```


## Listening to a scoped provider

To listen to a scoped provider, use the provider as usual by obtaining <Link documentID="concepts2/refs" />,
(such as with <Link documentID="concepts2/consumers" />).

```dart
final currentItemId = ref.watch(currentItemIdProvider);
```

If a provider is listening to a scoped provider, that scoped provider
needs to be included in the `dependencies` of the provider that is listening to it:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import '../usage/raw.dart';

class Item {}

Item fetchItem({required String id}) {
  // Simulate fetching an item from a database or API
  return Item();
}

/* SNIPPET START */
final currentItemProvider = FutureProvider<Item?>(
  // highlight-next-line
  dependencies: [currentItemIdProvider],
  (ref) async {
    final currentItemId = ref.watch(currentItemIdProvider);
    if (currentItemId == null) return null;

    // Fetch the item from a database or API
    return fetchItem(id: currentItemId);
  },
);

```


:::info
Inside `dependencies`, you only need to list scoped providers.
You do not need to list providers that are not scoped.
:::

## Setting the value of a scoped provider

To set a scoped provider, you can use <Link documentID="concepts2/overrides" />.
A typical example is to specify `overrides` on [ProviderScope] like so:


> **Snippet: override.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import '../../how_to/cancel/detail_screen/codegen.dart';
import 'usage/codegen.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  const HomePage({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ProviderScope(
      overrides: [
        // highlight-next-line
        currentItemIdProvider.overrideWithValue('123'),
      ],
      // The detail page will rely on '123' as the current item ID, without
      // having to pass it explicitly.
      child: const DetailPageView(),
    );
  }
}

```

---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import {
  AutoSnippet,
} from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

In Riverpod, _all_ providers can be overridden to change their behavior.
This is useful for testing, debugging, or providing different implementations in different environments,
or even <Link documentID="concepts2/scoping"/>.

Overriding a provider is done on <Link documentID="concepts2/containers"/>, using the `overrides` parameter.
In it, you can specify a list of instructions on how to override a specific provider.

Such "instruction" is created using your provider, combined with value methods named `overrideWithSomething`.  
There are a bunch of these methods available, but all of them have their name starting with `overrideWith`.
This includes:
- [overrideWith](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/latest/hooks_riverpod/Provider/overrideWith.html)
- [overrideWithValue](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/latest/hooks_riverpod/FutureProvider/overrideWithValue.html)
- [overrideWithBuild](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/latest/hooks_riverpod/StreamProvider/overrideWithBuild.html)

A typical override looks like this:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="scope" label="ProviderScope">

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(
    ProviderScope(
      overrides: [
        // Your overrides are defined here.
        // The following shows how to override a "counter provider"
        // to use a different initial value.
        counterProvider.overrideWith((ref) => 42),
      ]
    )
  );
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="container" label="ProviderContainer">

```dart
final container = ProviderContainer(
  overrides: [
    // Your overrides are defined here.
    // The following shows how to override a "counter provider"
    // to use a different initial value.
    counterProvider.overrideWith((ref) => 42),
  ]
);
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

import functionalFamily from './family/functional';
import notifierFamily from './family/notifier';
import singleOverride from 'raw-loader!./family/single_override.dart';
import allOverride from 'raw-loader!./family/all_overrides.dart';

One of Riverpod's most powerful feature is called "Families".  
In short, it allows a provider to be associated with multiple independent states,
based on a unique parameter combination.

A typical use-case is to fetch data from a remote API, where the response depends
on some parameters (such as a user ID or a search query or a page number). 
It enables defining a single provider that can be used to fetch and cache any possible
parameter combination.

![Graph showing how family links a provider to multiple independent states](/img/concepts2/family/users.svg)


:::info
If normal providers can be assimilated to a variable, then "family" providers can be
assimilated to a Map.
:::

## Creating a Family

Defining a family is done by slightly modifying the provider definition
to receive a parameter.

For functional providers, the syntax is as follows:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: inference_failure_on_function_invocation

import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class User {
  User();

  factory User.fromJson(_) => User();
}

/* SNIPPET START */
// When not using code-generation, providers can use ".family".
// This adds one generic parameter corresponding to the type of the parameter.
// The initialization function then receives the parameter.
final userProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose.family<User, String>((ref, id) async {
  final dio = Dio();
  final response = await dio.get('https://api.example.com/users/$id');

  return User.fromJson(response.data);
});

```


And for notifier providers, the syntax is:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: inference_failure_on_function_invocation

import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class User {
  User();

  factory User.fromJson(_) => User();
}

/* SNIPPET START */
// With notifiers providers, we also use ".family" and receive and extra
// generic argument.
// The main difference is that the associated Notifier needs to define
// a constructor+field to accept the argument.
final userProvider = AsyncNotifierProvider.autoDispose.family<UserNotifier, User, String>(
  UserNotifier.new,
);

class UserNotifier extends AsyncNotifier<User> {
  // We store the argument in a field, so that we can use it
  UserNotifier(this.id);
  final String id;

  @override
  Future<User> build() async {
    final dio = Dio();
    final response = await dio.get('https://api.example.com/users/$id');

    return User.fromJson(response.data);
  }
}

```


:::info
Although not strictly required, it is highly advised to enable <Link documentID="concepts2/auto_dispose" />
when using families.

This avoids memory leaks in case the parameter changes and the previous state is no longer needed.
:::

## Using a Family

Providers that receive parameters see their usage slightly modified too.

Long story short, you need to pass the parameters that your provider
expects, as follows:

```dart
final user = ref.watch(userProvider('123'));
```

:::caution
Parameters passed need to have a consistent `==`/`hashCode`.

View "family" as a Map, where the parameters are the key and the provider's state is the value.
As such, if the `==`/`hashCode` of a parameter changes, the value
obtained will be different.

Therefore code such as the following is incorrect:

```dart
// Incorrect parameter, as `[1, 2, 3] != [1, 2, 3]`
ref.watch(myProvider([1, 2, 3]));
```

To help spot this mistake, it is recommended to use the [riverpod_lint](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_lint)
and enable the [provider_parameters](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/tree/master/packages/riverpod_lint#provider_parameters)
lint rule. Then, the previous snippet would show a warning.
See <Link documentID="introduction/getting_started" hash="enabling-riverpod_lintcustom_lint" /> for installation steps.
:::


You can read as many "family" providers as you want, and they will all be independent. As such,
it is legal to do:

```dart
class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final user1 = ref.watch(userProvider('123'));
    final user2 = ref.watch(userProvider('456'));

    // user1 and user2 are independent.
  }
}
```

## Overriding families

When trying to mock a provider in tests, you may want to override a family provider.  

In that scenario, you have two options:
- Override only a specific parameter combination:
  
> **Snippet: single_override.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

import '../provider_observer_logger.dart';
import 'functional/codegen.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Example test', (tester) async {
    /* SNIPPET START */
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      ProviderScope(
        overrides: [
          // highlight-next-line
          userProvider('123').overrideWith((ref) => User(name: 'User 123')),
        ],
        child: const MyApp(),
      ),
    );
    /* SNIPPET END */
  });
}

```

- Override all parameter combinations:
  
> **Snippet: all_overrides.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

import '../provider_observer_logger.dart';
import 'functional/codegen.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Example test', (tester) async {
    /* SNIPPET START */
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      ProviderScope(
        overrides: [
          // highlight-next-line
          userProvider.overrideWith((ref, arg) => User(name: 'User $arg')),
        ],
        child: const MyApp(),
      ),
    );
    /* SNIPPET END */
  });
}

```




==================================================
FILE: concepts2/retry.mdx
==================================================

---
title: Automatic retry
---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import {
  AutoSnippet,
} from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";

In Riverpod, <Link documentID="concepts2/providers"/> are automatically retried when they fail.

A retry is attempted when an exception is thrown during the provider's computation.
The retry logic can be customized either on a per-provider basis or globally for all providers.

By default, a provider can be retried up to 10 times, with an exponential backoff 
going from 200ms to 6.4 seconds.
For the full details about the default retry logic, see [retry].

## Customizing retry logic

A custom retry logic can be provided either for the full application or for a specific provider.

The implementation is the same for both cases: Custom retry logic is a function that is expected
to return a `Duration?` value ; which indicates the delay before the next retry (or `null` to stop retrying).

The following implements a custom [retry] function, which
will retry up to 5 times, with an exponential backoff starting at 200ms, and ignores
[ProviderException]s

```dart
Duration? myRetry(int retryCount, Object error) {
  // Stop retrying on ProviderException
  if (retryCount >= 5) return null;
  // Ignore ProviderException
  if (error is ProviderException) return null;

  return Duration(milliseconds: 200 * (1 << retryCount)); // Exponential backoff
}
```

This function can then be used either inside providers to update the retry logic
for that specific provider:

<AutoSnippet
  codegen={`
  // highlight-next-line
  @Riverpod(retry: myRetry)
  int myProvider(MyProviderRef ref) {
    return 0;
  }
  `}
  raw={`final myProvider = Provider<int>(
    // highlight-next-line
    retry: myRetry,
    (ref) => 0,
  );
  `}
/>

Or globally by passing it to <Link documentID="concepts2/containers" />:

```dart
// For pure Dart code
final container = ProviderContainer(
  // highlight-next-line
  retry: myRetry,
);

...

// For Flutter code
runApp(
  ProviderScope(
    // highlight-next-line
    retry: myRetry,
    child: MyApp(),
  ),
);
```

### Disabling retry

Disabling retry is as simple as always retuning `null` in the retry function.
If you wish to disable retry for all your application, do:

```dart
runApp(
  ProviderScope(
    // highlight-next-line
    retry: (retryCount, error) => null,
    child: MyApp(),
  ),
);
```

## About the default retry logic

The default retry logic is designed to be a more more clever than a naive "if fail, retry".
In particular, it will not retry [Error]s and [ProviderException]s.

Errors are not retried, because they are not recoverable. They indicate a bug in the code, and retrying
would not help. Retrying in those cases would just pollute the logs with useless retry attempts.

As for ProviderExceptions, those are not retried because they indicate
that a provider did not fail, but instead rethrow an exception from a failed provider. Consider:

<AutoSnippet
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  int failed(MyProviderRef ref) {
    throw Exception('This provider always fails');
  }
  
  @riverpod
  int myProvider(MyProviderRef ref) {
    // This provider depends on a failed provider,
    // and will therefore throw a ProviderException
    return ref.watch(failedProvider);
  }
  `}
  raw={`
  final failedProvider = Provider<int>(
    (ref) => throw Exception('This provider always fails'),
  );
  
  final myProvider = Provider<int>(
    // This provider depends on a failed provider,
    // and will therefore throw a ProviderException
    (ref) => ref.watch(failedProvider),
  );
  `}
/>

In this example, although `myProvider` fails, it is not responsible for the failure.
Retrying it would not help. Instead, it is `failedProvider` that should be retried.

This implies that if you disable retry for `failedProvider`, then `myProvider` will also not be retried.

## Awaiting for retries to complete

You may be aware that you can await for asynchronous providers to complete, by using [FutureProvider.future]:

```dart
final value = await ref.watch(myProvider.future);
```

But you may wonder how automatic retry interacts with this.

In short, when an asynchronous provider fails and is retried, the associated future
will keep waiting until either:
- all retries are exhausted, or
- the provider succeeds.

This ensures that `await ref.watch(myProvider.future)` skips the intermediate failures.

FILE: concepts2/observers.mdx
==================================================

---
title: ProviderObservers
---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import logger from "!!raw-loader!/docs/concepts2/provider_observer_logger.dart";
import { trimSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";

A [ProviderObserver] is an object used to observe provider lifecycle events in the application.
They are generally used for logging, analytics, or debugging purposes. 

## Usage

To use a [ProviderObserver], you need to extend the class and override the life-cycles you want to observe.
There are many methods available. It is recommended to check its [documentation][ProviderObserver] for more details.

## Example: Logger

The following observer logs all state changes of any provider in the application:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(logger)}</CodeBlock>

Now, every time the value of our provider is updated, the logger will log it:

```
{
  "provider": "Provider<int>",
  "newValue": "1"
}
```

To improve debugging, you can optionally give your providers a name:  
```dart
final myProvider = Provider<int>((ref) => 0, name: 'MyProvider');
```

With this change, the log becomes:
```
{
  "provider": "MyProvider",
  "newValue": "1"
}
```

:::tip
When using code-generation, a name is automatically assigned to providers.
:::


:::note
If the state of a provider is mutated, (typically Lists, combined with [Ref.notifyListeners]),
it is likely that `didUpdateProvider` will receive `previousValue` and `newValue` as the same value.

This happens because Dart updates objects by "reference".
If you want to change this, you will have to clone your objects before mutating them.

==================================================
FILE: concepts2/refs.mdx
==================================================

---
title: Refs
---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import {
  AutoSnippet,
} from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";

Refs are the primary way to interact with <Link documentID="concepts2/providers"/>.  
Refs are fairly similar to the `BuildContext` in Flutter, but for providers instead of widgets.
A non-exhaustive list of things you can do with a ref:
- read/observe the state of a provider
- check if a provider currently is loaded or
- reset the state of a provider

On top of that, [Ref] also enables a provider to observe life-cycles about its own state.
Think "initState" and "dispose", but for providers. This includes methods such as:
- [onDispose]
- [onCancel]

- etc.

## How to obtain a [Ref]

Obtaining a [Ref] depends on where you are in your app.

Providers naturally have access to a Ref. You can find it as parameter of 
the initializer function, or as a property of Notifier classes.

<AutoSnippet
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  int myProvider(Ref ref) {
    // ref is available here
    ...
  }
  
  @riverpod
  class MyNotifier extends _$MyNotifier {
    @override
    int build() {
      // this.ref is available anywhere inside notifiers
      ref.watch(someProvider);
      ...
    }
  }
  `}
  raw={`
  final myProvider = Provider<int>((ref) {
    // ref is available here
    ...
  });
  
  final myNotifierProvider = NotifierProvider<MyNotifier, int>(MyNotifier.new);
  
  class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
    @override
    int build() {
      // this.ref is available anywhere inside notifiers
      ref.watch(someProvider);
      ...
    }
  }
  `}
/>

To obtain a [Ref] inside widgets, you need <Link documentID="concepts2/consumers"/>.

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, _) {
    // ref is available here
    final value = ref.watch(myProvider);
    return Text('$value');
  },
);
```

**I am never inside a widget, nor a provider. How do I get a Ref then?**  
If you are neither inside widgets nor providers, chances are whatever you are using
is still loosely connected to a widget/provider.

In that case, simply pass the ref you obtained from your widget/provider to your function/object of choice:

```dart
void myFunction(WidgetRef ref) {
  // You can pass the ref around!
}

...

Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, _) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () => myFunction(ref), // Pass the ref to your function
      child: Text('Click me'),
    );
  },
);
```

## Using Refs to interact with providers

Interactions with providers generally fall under two categories:
- Listening to a provider's state
- Modifying a provider's state 
  (e.g., resetting it, updating it, etc.)

### Listening to a provider's state

Riverpod offers two ways to listen to a provider's state:
- [Ref.watch] - This is a "declarative" way of listening to providers.  
  It is the most common way to listen to providers, and should be your go to choice.
- [Ref.listen] - This is a "manual" way of listening to providers.  
  It uses a typical "addListener" style of listening. Powerful, but more complex.

For the following examples, consider a provider that updates every second:

<AutoSnippet
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  class Tick extends _$Tick {
    @override
    int build() {
      final timer = Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (_) => state++);
      ref.onDispose(timer.cancel);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  `}
  raw={`
  final tickProvider = NotifierProvider<Tick, int>(Tick.new);
  class Tick extends Notifier<int> {
    @override
    int build() {
      final timer = Timer.periodic(Duration(seconds: 1), (_) => state++);
      ref.onDispose(timer.cancel);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  `}
/>

#### Ref.watch

[Ref.watch] is Riverpod's defining feature. It enables combining providers together seamlessly,
and easily have your UI update when a provider's state changes.

Using [Ref.watch] is similar to using an `InheritedWidget` in Flutter.
In Flutter, when you call `Theme.of(context)`, your widget subscribes to the `Theme`
and will rebuild whenever the `Theme` changes. Similarly, when you call `ref.watch(myProvider)`,
your widget/provider subscribes to `myProvider`, and will rebuild whenever `myProvider` changes.

The following code shows a <Link documentID="concepts2/consumers"/> that automatically updates whenever our `Tick` provider updates:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, _) {
    final tick = ref.watch(tickProvider);
    return Text('Tick: $tick');
  },
);
```

The most interesting part of [Ref.watch] is that providers can use it too!  
For example, we could create a provider that returns "is tick divisible by 4?":

<AutoSnippet
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  bool isDivisibleBy4(Ref ref) {
    final tick = ref.watch(tickProvider);
    return tick % 4 == 0;
  }
  `}
  raw={`
  final isDivisibleBy4 = Provider<bool>((ref) {
    final tick = ref.watch(tickProvider);
    return tick % 4 == 0;
  });
  `}
/>

Then, we could listen to this new provider in our UI instead:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, _) {
    final isDivisibleBy4 = ref.watch(isDivisibleBy4Provider);
    return Text('Can tick be divided by 4? ${isDivisibleBy4}');
  },
);
```

Now, instead of updating every second, our UI will only update
when the boolean value changes.  

#### Ref.listen

[Ref.listen] is a more manual way of listening to providers.
It is similar to the `addListener` method of `ChangeNotifier`, or the `Stream.listen` method.

This method is useful when you want to perform a side-effect when a provider's state changes, such as
- Showing a dialog
- Navigating to a new screen

    return Text('Listening to tick changes');
  },
);
```

:::note
It is safe to use [WidgetRef.listen] inside the `build` method of a widget. This is how the
method is designed to be used.  
If you want to listen to providers outside of `build` (such as `State.initState`), use [WidgetRef.listenManual] instead.
:::


### Resetting a provider's state

Using [Ref.invalidate], you can reset a provider's state.  
This will tell Riverpod to discard the current state and re-evaluate the provider the next time it is read.

The following example will reset the tick to `0`:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, _) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        // Reset the tick provider
        // This will restart the tick from 0
        ref.invalidate(tickProvider);
      },
      child: Text('Reset Tick'),
    );
  },
);
```

:::tip
If you need to obtain the new state right after resetting it, you can call [Ref.read]:

```dart
ref.invalidate(tickProvider);
final newTick = ref.read(tickProvider);
```
Alternatively, you can use [Ref.refresh] to reset the provider and read its new state in one go:
```dart
final newTick = ref.refresh(tickProvider);
```

Both codes are strictly equivalent. [Ref.refresh] is syntax sugar for [Ref.invalidate] followed by [Ref.read].
:::


### Interacting with the provider's state inside user interactions

A last use-case is to interact with a provider's state inside button clicks.
In this scenario, we do not want to "listen" to the state. For this case, [Ref.read] exists.

You can safely call [Ref.read] button clicks to perform work. The following example
will print the current tick value when the button is clicked:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, _) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        // Read the current tick value
        final tick = ref.read(tickProvider);
        print('Current tick: $tick');
      },
      child: Text('Print Tick'),
    );
  },
);
```

:::danger
Do not use [Ref.read] as a mean to "optimize" your code by avoiding [Ref.watch].
This will make your code more brittle, as changes in your provider's behavior could cause your
UI to be out of sync with the provider's state.

Either use [Ref.watch] anyway (as the difference is negligible) or use [select]:
```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, _) {
    // ❌ Don't use "read" as a mean to ignore changes
    final tick = ref.read(tickProvider);

    // ✅ Use "watch" to listen to changes.
    // This shouldn't be a bottle-neck in your apps. Do not over-optimize.
    final tick = ref.watch(tickProvider);

    // ✅ Use "select" to only listen to the specific part of the state you care about
    final isEven = ref.watch(
      tickProvider.select((tick) => tick.isEven),
    );

    ...
  },
);
```
:::


### Listening to life-cycle events

A provider-specific feature of [Ref] is the ability to listen to life-cycle events.
These events are similar to the `initState`, `dispose`, and other life-cycle methods in Flutter widgets.

Life-cycles listeners are registered using an "addListener" style API.
Listeners are methods with a name that starts with `on`, such as [onDispose] or [onCancel].

<AutoSnippet
  codegen={`
  @riverpod
  int counter(Ref ref) {
    ref.onDispose(() {
      // This is called when the provider is disposed
      print('Counter provider is being disposed');
    });
    
    return 0;
  }
  `}
  raw={`
  final counterProvider = Provider<int>((ref) {
    ref.onDispose(() {
      // This is called when the provider is disposed
      print('Counter provider is being disposed');
    });
    
    return 0;
  });
  `}
/>


:::tip
You do not need to "unregister" these listeners.  
Riverpod automatically cleans them up when the provider is reset.

Although if you wish to unregister them manually, you can do so by using the return
value of the listener method.

```dart
final unregister = ref.onDispose(() {
  print('This will never be called');
});

// This will unregister the "onDispose" listener
unregister();
```

:::caution
Mutations are experimental, and the API may change in a breaking way without
a major version bump.
:::

Mutations, in Riverpod, are objects which enable the user interface
to react to state changes.
A common use-case is displaying a loading indicator while a form is being submitted

In short, mutations are to achieve effects such as this:
![Submit progress indicator](/img/concepts2/mutations/spinner.gif)!

Without mutations, you would have to store the progress of the form submission
directly inside the state of a provider. This is not ideal as it pollutes the
state of your provider with UI concerns ; and it involves a lot of boilerplate code
to handle the loading state, error state, and success state.

Mutations are designed to handle these concerns in a more elegant way.

## Defining a mutation

Mutations are instances of the [Mutation] object, stored in a final variable somewhere.

```dart
// A mutation to track the "add todo" operation.
// The generic type is optional and can be specified to enable the UI to interact
// with the result of the mutation.
final addTodo = Mutation<Todo>();
```

:::note
Typically, this variable will either be global or as a `static final` variable on
a [Notifier].
:::

## Listening to a mutation

Once we've defined a mutation, we can start using it inside <Link documentID="concepts2/consumers" /> or <Link documentID="concepts2/providers" />.  
For this, we will need a <Link documentID="concepts2/refs" /> and pick a listening method of our choice
(typically [Ref.watch]).

A typical example would be:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(listener)}</CodeBlock>

### Scoping a mutation

Sometimes, you may want to have multiple instances of the same mutation.

This can include things like an id, or any other parameter that makes the mutation unique.

This is useful if you want to have multiple instances of the same mutation,
such as deleting a specific item in a list

Simply call the mutation with the unique key:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(keyed)}</CodeBlock>

Sometimes, these mutations have a generic return type,
such as if an api response may have different response types
based on the input parameters, such as with deserialization.

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(generic)}</CodeBlock>

### Triggering a mutation

So far, we've listened to the state of a mutation, but nothing actually happens yet.

To trigger a mutation, we can use [Mutation.run], pass our mutation, and provide an asynchronous callback
that updates whatever state we want. Lastly, we'll need to return a value matching the generic type of the mutation.

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(triggering)}</CodeBlock>

### The different mutation states and their meaning

Mutations can be in one of the following states:
- [MutationPending]: The mutation has started and is currently loading.
- [MutationError]: The mutation has failed, and an error is available.
- [MutationSuccess]: The mutation has succeeded, and the result is available.
- [MutationIdle]: The mutation has not been called yet, or has been reset.

You can switch over the different states using a `switch` statement:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(switching)}</CodeBlock>

### After a mutation has been started once, how to reset it to its idle state?

Mutations naturally reset themselves to [MutationIdle] if:
- They have completed (either successfully or with an error).
- All listeners have been removed (e.g. the spinner widget has been removed)

This is similar to how <Link documentID="concepts2/auto_dispose"/> works, but for mutations.

Alternatively, you can manually reset a mutation to its idle state
by calling the [Mutation.reset] method:

<CodeBlock>{trimSnippet(resetting)}</CodeBlock>

Providers are the central feature of Riverpod. If you use Riverpod, you use it for its providers.

## What is a provider?

Providers are essentially "memoized functions", with sugar on top.  
What this means is, providers are functions which will return a cached value
when called with the same parameters.

The most common use-case for using providers is to perform a network request.  
Consider a function that fetches a user from an API:

```dart
Future<User> fetchUser() async {
  final response = await http.get('https://api.example.com/user/123');
  return User.fromJson(response.body);
}
```

One issue with this function is, if we were to try using it inside widgets,
we'd have to cache the result ourselves ; then figure out a way to share 
the value across all widgets that need it.

That is where providers come in. Providers are wrappers around functions. 
They will cache the result of said function and allow multiple widgets
to access the same value:

<AutoSnippet
  language="dart"
  codegen={`
  // The equivalent of our fetchUser function, but the result is cached.
  // This will generate a "userProvider". Using it multiple times will
  // return the same value.
  @riverpod
  Future<User> user(Ref ref) async {
    final response = await http.get('https://api.example.com/user/123');
    return User.fromJson(response.body);
  }
  `}
  raw={`
  // The equivalent of our fetchUser function, but the result is cached.
  // Using userProvider multiple times will return the same value.
  final userProvider = FutureProvider<User>((ref) async {
    final response = await http.get('https://api.example.com/user/123');
    return User.fromJson(response.body);
  });
  `}
  ></AutoSnippet>

On top of basic caching, providers then add various features to make
them more powerful:

- **Built-in cache invalidation mechanisms**  
  In particular, [Ref.watch](https://pub.dev/documentation/riverpod/latest/riverpod/Ref/watch.html)
  allows you to combine caches together, automatically invalidating what is needed.
- **<Link documentID="concepts2/auto_dispose" />** <br/>
  Providers can automatically release resources when they are no longer needed.
- **Data-binding**  
  Providers remove the need for a [FutureBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html)
  or a [StreamBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StreamBuilder-class.html).
- **Automatic error handling**  
  Providers can automatically catch errors and expose them to the UI.
- **Mocking support**  
  For better testing and other purposes, all providers can be mocked.
  See <Link documentID="concepts2/overrides" />.
- **<Link documentID="concepts2/offline"/>** <br/>
  The result of a provider can be persisted to disk and automatically
  reloaded when the app is restarted.
- **<Link documentID="concepts2/mutations" />** <br/>
  Providers offer a built-in way for UIs render a spinner/error for side effects (such as form submission).

Providers come 6 variants:

|              | Synchronous      | Future                | Stream                 |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Unmodifiable | [Provider]         | [FutureProvider]        | [StreamProvider]         |
| Modifiable   | [NotifierProvider] | [AsyncNotifierProvider] | [StreamNotifierProvider] |

This may seem overwhelming at first. Let's break it down.

**Sync** vs **Future** vs **Stream**:  
The columns of this table represent the built-in Dart types for functions.
```dart
int synchronous() => 0;
Future<int> future() async => 0;
Stream<int> stream() => Stream.value(0);
```

**Unmodifiable vs Modifiable**:  
By default, providers are not modifiable by widgets. The "Notifier" variant of
providers make them externally modifiable.  
This is similar to a private setter ("unmodifiable" providers)
```dart
// _state is internally modifiable
// but cannot be modified externally
var _state = 0;
int get state => _state;
```
VS a public setter ("modifiable" providers)
```dart
// Anything can modify "state"
var state = 0;
```

:::info
You can also view **unmodifiable** vs **modifiable** as respectively `StatelessWidget` vs `StatefulWidget` in principle.  

This is not entirely accurate, as providers are not widgets and both kinds store "state".
But the principle is similar: "One object, immutable" vs "Two objects, mutable".
:::


## Creating a provider

Providers should be created as "top-level" declarations.  
This means that they should be declared outside of any class or function.

The syntax for creating a provider depends on whether it is "modifiable" or "unmodifiable",
as per the table above.

:::info
You can declare as many providers as you want without limitations.
As opposed to when using `package:provider`, Riverpod allows creating multiple
providers exposing a state of the same "type":


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */

final cityProvider = Provider((ref) => 'London');
final countryProvider = Provider((ref) => 'England');

```
 for more information.

Long story short, before you can use a provider, wrap your Flutter applications
in a [ProviderScope]:

```dart
void main() {
  runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}
```

Once that is done, you will need to obtain a [Ref] to interact with your providers. 
See <Link documentID="concepts2/refs" /> for information about those.

In short, there are two ways to obtain a [Ref]:
- Providers naturally get access to one.  
  This is the first parameter of the provider function, or the `ref` property of a Notifier.
  This enables providers to communicate with each other.
- The Widget tree will need special kind of widgets, called <Link documentID="concepts2/consumers" />.
  Those widgets bridge the gap between the widget tree and the provider tree, by giving you a [WidgetRef].

As example, consider a `helloWorldProvider` that returns a simple string.
You could use it inside widgets like this:

```dart
class Example extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Consumer(
      builder: (context, ref, _) {
        // Obtain the value of the provider
        final helloWorld = ref.watch(helloWorldProvider);

        // Use the value in the UI
        return Text(helloWorld);
      },
    );
  }
}
```

FILE: concepts2/auto_dispose.mdx
==================================================

---
title: Automatic disposal
version: 2
---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import { AutoSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import onDisposeExample from "./auto_dispose/on_dispose_example";
import invalidateExample from "!!raw-loader!./auto_dispose/invalidate_example.dart";
import keepAlive from "./auto_dispose/keep_alive";
import cacheForExtension from "!!raw-loader!./auto_dispose/cache_for_extension.dart";
import cacheForUsage from "./auto_dispose/cache_for_usage";
import invalidateFamilyExample from './auto_dispose/invalidate_family_example'

In Riverpod, it is possible to tell the framework to automatically
destroy resources associated with a provider when it is no longer used.

## Enabling/disabling automatic disposal

If you're using code-generation, this is enabled by default, and can be opted
out in the annotation:
```dart
// Disable automatic disposal
@Riverpod(keepAlive: true)
String helloWorld(Ref ref) => 'Hello world!';
```

If you're not using code-generation, you can enable it by using `isAutoDispose: true`
when creating the provider:
```dart
final helloWorldProvider = Provider<String>(
  // Opt-in to automatic disposal
  isAutoDispose: true,
  (ref) => 'Hello world!',
);
```

:::note
Enabling/disabling automatic disposal has no impact on whether or not
the state is destroyed when the provider is recomputed.  
The state will always be destroyed when the provider is recomputed.
:::

:::caution
When providers receive parameters, it is recommended to enable automatic disposal.
That is because otherwise, one state per parameter combination will be created,
which can lead to memory leaks.
:::

## When is automatic disposal triggered?

When automatic disposal is enabled, Riverpod will track whether a provider has listeners or not.
This happens by tracking [Ref.watch](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/latest/hooks_riverpod/Ref/watch.html)/[Ref.listen](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/latest/hooks_riverpod/Ref/listen.html)
calls (and a few others).  

When that counter reaches zero, the provider is considered "not used", and
[Ref.onCancel](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/latest/hooks_riverpod/Ref/onCancel.html)
is triggered. 
At that point, Riverpod waits for one frame (cf. `await null`). If, after that frame,
the provider is still not used, then the provider is destroyed and
[Ref.onDispose](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/latest/hooks_riverpod/Ref/onDispose.html)
will be triggered.
## Reacting to state disposal

In Riverpod, there are a few built-in ways for state to be destroyed:

- The provider is no longer used and is in "auto dispose" mode (more on that later).
  In this case, all associated state with the provider is destroyed.
- The provider is recomputed, such as with `ref.watch`.
  In that case, the previous state is disposed, and a new state is created.

In both cases, you may want to execute some logic when that happens.  
This can be achieved with `ref.onDispose`. This method enables
registering a listener for whenever the state is destroyed.

For example, you may want to use it to close any active `StreamController`:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart

import 'dart:async';

import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
final provider = StreamProvider<int>((ref) {
  final controller = StreamController<int>();

  // {@template onDispose}
  // When the state is destroyed, we close the StreamController.
  // {@endtemplate}
  ref.onDispose(controller.close);

  // {@template todo}
  // TO-DO: Push some values in the StreamController
  // {@endtemplate}
  return controller.stream;
});
/* SNIPPET END */

```


:::caution
The callback of `ref.onDispose` must not trigger side-effects.
Modifying providers inside `onDispose` could lead to unexpected behavior.
:::

:::info
There are other useful life-cycles such as:

- `ref.onCancel` which is called when the last listener of a provider is removed.
- `ref.onResume` which is called when a new listener is added after `onCancel` was invoked.

:::

:::info
You can call `ref.onDispose` as many times as you wish.
Feel free to call it once per disposable object in your provider. This practice
makes it easier to spot when we forget to dispose of something.
:::

## Manually forcing the destruction of a provider, using `ref.invalidate`

Sometimes, you may want to force the destruction of a provider.
This can be done by using `ref.invalidate`, which can be called from another
provider or a widget.

Using `ref.invalidate` will destroy the current provider state.
There are then two possible outcomes:

- If the provider is listened to, a new state will be created.
- If the provider is not listened to, the provider will be fully destroyed.


> **Snippet: invalidate_example.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: use_key_in_widget_constructors

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

// We can specify autoDispose to enable automatic state destruction.
final someProvider = Provider.autoDispose<int>((ref) {
  return 0;
});

/* SNIPPET START */
class MyWidget extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () {
        // {@template invalidate}
        // On click, destroy the provider.
        // {@endtemplate}
        ref.invalidate(someProvider);
      },
      child: const Text('dispose a provider'),
    );
  }
}

```


:::info
It is possible for providers to invalidate themselves by using `ref.invalidateSelf`.
Although in this case, this will always result in a new state being created.
:::

:::tip
When trying to invalidate a provider which receives parameters,
it is possible to either invalidate one specific parameter combination,
or all parameter combinations at once:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

late WidgetRef ref;

/* SNIPPET START */
final provider = Provider.autoDispose.family<String, String>((ref, name) {
  return 'Hello $name';
});

// ...

void onTap() {
  // {@template invalidateAll}
  // Invalidate all possible parameter combinations of this provider.
  // {@endtemplate}
  ref.invalidate(provider);
  // {@template invalidate}
  // Invalidate a specific combination only
  // {@endtemplate}
  ref.invalidate(provider('John'));
}
/* SNIPPET END */

```

:::

## Fine-tuned disposal with `ref.keepAlive`

As mentioned above, when automatic disposal is enabled, the state is destroyed
when the provider has no listeners for a full frame.

But you may want to have more control over this behavior. For instance,
you may want to keep the state of successful network requests,
but not cache failed requests.

This can be achieved with `ref.keepAlive`, after enabling automatic disposal.
Using it, you can decide _when_ the state stops being automatically disposed.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable

import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
final provider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<String>((ref) async {
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('https://example.com'));
  // {@template keepAlive}
  // We keep the provider alive only after the request has successfully completed.
  // If the request failed (and threw an exception), then when the provider stops being
  // listened to, the state will be destroyed.
  // {@endtemplate}
  final link = ref.keepAlive();

  // {@template closeLink}
  // We can use the `link` to restore the auto-dispose behavior with:
  // {@endtemplate}
  // link.close();

  return response.body;
});
/* SNIPPET END */

```


:::note
If the provider is recomputed, automatic disposal will be re-enabled.

It is also possible to use the return value of `ref.keepAlive` to
revert to automatic disposal.
:::

## Example: keeping state alive for a specific amount of time

Currently, Riverpod does not offer a built-in way to keep state alive
for a specific amount of time.  
But implementing such a feature is easy and reusable with the tools we've seen so far.

By using a `Timer` + `ref.keepAlive`, we can keep the state alive for a specific amount of time.
To make this logic reusable, we could implement it in an extension method:


> **Snippet: cache_for_extension.dart**
```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
extension CacheForExtension on Ref {
  // {@template cacheFor}
  /// Keeps the provider alive for [duration].
  // {@endtemplate}
  void cacheFor(Duration duration) {
    // {@template keepAlive}
    // Immediately prevent the state from getting destroyed.
    // {@endtemplate}
    final link = keepAlive();
    // {@template timer}
    // After duration has elapsed, we re-enable automatic disposal.
    // {@endtemplate}
    final timer = Timer(duration, link.close);

    // {@template onDispose}
    // Optional: when the provider is recomputed (such as with ref.watch),
    // we cancel the pending timer.
    // {@endtemplate}
    onDispose(timer.cancel);
  }
}

```


Then, we can use it like so:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async

import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

import '../cache_for_extension.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
final provider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<Object>((ref) async {
  // {@template cacheFor}
  /// Keeps the state alive for 5 minutes
  // {@endtemplate}
  ref.cacheFor(const Duration(minutes: 5));

  return http.get(Uri.https('example.com'));
});
/* SNIPPET END */

```


This logic can be tweaked to fit your needs. 
For example, you could use `ref.onCancel`/`ref.onResume` to destroy the state
only if a provider hasn't been listened to for a specific amount of time.



==================================================
FILE: concepts2/containers.mdx
==================================================

---
title: ProviderContainers/ProviderScopes
---
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";

[ProviderContainer] is _the_ central piece of Riverpod's architecture.  
In Riverpod, [Providers](./providers.mdx) hold no state themselves. Instead,
the state of a given provider is stored inside this container object.

[ProviderScope] is a widget that creates a [ProviderContainer] and exposes it to the 
widget tree. Hence why, when you use Riverpod, you will always see a scope at the root of apps.  
Without it, Riverpod would be unable to store the state of providers!

### Using a ProviderContainer for pure Dart applications

[ProviderContainer] is a useful object when you want to use Riverpod
in pure Dart codebases, such as command-line applications or server-side applications.

You can create a [ProviderContainer] inside your `main`, and use it to read and modify providers:

```dart
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

void main() {
  final container = ProviderContainer();

  try {
    final sub = container.listen(counterProvider, (previous, next) {
      print('Counter changed from $previous to $next');
    });
    print('Counter starts at ${sub.read()}');
  } finally {
    // Dispose the container when done
    container.dispose();
  }
}
```

:::note
Inside tests, do not use [ProviderContainer] directly.
Use [ProviderContainer.test](https://pub.dev/documentation/hooks_riverpod/latest/hooks_riverpod/ProviderContainer/ProviderContainer.test.html) instead.
This will automatically dispose the container when the test ends.

```dart
test('Counter starts at 0 and can be incremented', () {
  // No need to dispose the container when the test ends
  final container = ProviderContainer.test();

  // Use the container to test your providers
});
```
:::

### Using a ProviderScope for Flutter applications

In Flutter applications, you shouldn't use [ProviderContainer] directly.
Instead, you should use [ProviderScope], which is a widget equivalent of [ProviderContainer].

The end-result is the same: Create a [ProviderScope] in your `main`. After that, you can
use [Consumers](./consumers.mdx) to read and modify providers in your widgets.

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(
    ProviderScope(
      child: Consumer(
        builder: (context, ref, _) {
          final counter = ref.watch(counterProvider);

          // TODO use "counter"
        },
      ),
    ),
  );
}
```

## Why store the state of providers inside a container?

One might wonder why providers don't store their state themselves.
If we got rid of that requirement, we could imagine a world where we could write:

```dart
print(helloWorldProvider.value); // Prints "Hello world!"
```

instead of having to write `ref.watch(helloWorldProvider)`.

Riverpod does this for a few reasons, which come down the same logic: "No global state".

1. Better separation of concerns.  
  If Riverpod were to allow providers to store their own state,
  it would imply that _anything_ could read/write to that state. This means
  that it would be difficult to control how/when a state is modified.

  Using Riverpod's architecture, state updates are centralized: All the logic
  for modifying a provider is done in the provider itself.
  And generally, the UI will only invoke one method on the provider's Notifier.

1. Better testing.
  By storing the state of providers inside a container, we do not have to worry about
  resetting the application state between tests. We can simply create a new container
  for each test, and a fresh state will be created for each provider:

  ```dart
  test('Counter starts at 0 and can be incremented', () {
    final container = ProviderContainer.test();

    expect(container.read(counterProvider), 0);
    container.read(counterProvider.notifier).increment();
    expect(container.read(counterProvider), 1);
  });

  test('Counter cannot go below 0', () {
    final container = ProviderContainer.test();

    expect(container.read(counterProvider), 0);
    container.read(counterProvider.notifier).decrement();
    expect(container.read(counterProvider), 0);
  });
  ```
  Here, we can see that both tests rely on the same provider. Yet state changes
  inside one test do not affect the other test.

  Of course, the same applies when using [ProviderScope] and widget tests.

1. A centralized place for configuring your application.  
  Through [ProviderContainer] and [ProviderScope], we can configure various app-wide
  aspects of Riverpod. For example:
    * We can define a custom [ProviderObserver] to listen to all state changes in the app.
      See <Link documentID="concepts2/observers"/>.
    * We can override providers, either locally or globally. This
      can be useful for testing or for applications with different environments,
      or for development.
      See <Link documentID="concepts2/overrides"/>.

1. Support for <Link documentID="concepts2/scoping"/>.
  By storing the state of a provider inside a container, we can have the same provider
  resolve to a different state depending on where in the widget tree it is used.
  This feature is quite advanced and generally discouraged, but useful for performance
  optimizations.

## Try Riverpod online

To get a feel of Riverpod, try it online on [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/?null_safety=true&id=ef06ab3ce0b822e6cc5db0575248e6e2)
or on [Zapp](https://zapp.run/new):

<iframe

  style={{ width: "100%", border: 0, overflow: "hidden", aspectRatio: "1.5" }}
></iframe>

## Installing the package

Riverpod comes as a main "riverpod" package that’s self-sufficient, complemented by optional packages for using code generation (<Link documentID="concepts/about_code_generation" />) and hooks (<Link documentID="concepts/about_hooks" />).

Once you know what package(s) you want to install, proceed to add the dependency to your app in a single line like this:

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="flutter_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: 'Flutter', value: 'flutter_riverpod', },
    { label: 'Dart only', value: 'riverpod', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

<AutoSnippet {...pubadd}></AutoSnippet>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="riverpod">

<AutoSnippet {...dartPubadd}></AutoSnippet>

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Alternatively, you can manually add the dependency to your app from within your `pubspec.yaml`:

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="flutter_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: 'Flutter', value: 'flutter_riverpod', },
    { label: 'Dart only', value: 'riverpod', },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

<AutoSnippet title="pubspec.yaml" language="yaml" {...pubspec}></AutoSnippet>

Then, install packages with `flutter pub get`.


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="riverpod">

<AutoSnippet
  title="pubspec.yaml"
  language="yaml"
  {...dartPubspec}
></AutoSnippet>

Then, install packages with `dart pub get`.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
If using code-generation, you can now run the code-generator with:
```sh
dart run build_runner watch -d
```
:::

That's it. You've added [Riverpod] to your app!

## Enabling riverpod_lint

Riverpod comes with an optional [riverpod_lint]
package that provides lint rules to help you write better code, and
provide custom refactoring options.

Riverpod_lint is implemented using [analysis_server_plugin]. As such, it is installed through `analysis_options.yaml`

Long story short, create an `analysis_options.yaml` next to your `pubspec.yaml` and add:

```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
plugins:
  riverpod_lint: <latest version from https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_lint>
```

You should now see warnings in your IDE if you made mistakes when using Riverpod
in your codebase.

To see the full list of warnings and refactorings, head to the [riverpod_lint] page.

## Usage example: Hello world

Now that we have installed [Riverpod], we can start using it.

The following snippets showcase how to use our new dependency to make a "Hello world":

export const foo = 42;

<Tabs
  groupId="riverpod"
  defaultValue="flutter_riverpod"
  values={[
    { label: "Flutter", value: "flutter_riverpod" },
    { label: "Dart only", value: "riverpod" },
  ]}
>
<TabItem value="flutter_riverpod">

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/main.dart"
  language="dart"
  {...helloWorld}
></AutoSnippet>

Then, start the application with `flutter run`.  
This will render "Hello world" on your device.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="riverpod">

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/main.dart"
  language="dart"
  {...dartHelloWorld}
></AutoSnippet>

Then, start the application with `dart lib/main.dart`.  
This will print "Hello world" in the console.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

FILE: how_to/cancel.mdx
==================================================

---
title: How to debounce/cancel network requests
version: 1
---

import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import { AutoSnippet, When } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import homeScreen from "!raw-loader!./cancel/home_screen.dart";
import extension from "!raw-loader!./cancel/extension.dart";
import detailScreen from "./cancel/detail_screen";
import detailScreenCancel from "./cancel/detail_screen_cancel";
import detailScreenDebounce from "./cancel/detail_screen_debounce";
import providerWithExtension from "./cancel/provider_with_extension";

As applications grow in complexity, it's common to have multiple network requests
in flight at the same time. For example, a user might be typing in a search box
and triggering a new request for each keystroke. If the user types quickly, the
application might have many requests in flight at the same time.

Alternatively, a user might trigger a request, then navigate to a different page
before the request completes. In this case, the application might have a request
in flight that is no longer needed.

To optimize performance in those situations, there are a few techniques you can
use:

- "Debouncing" requests. This means that you wait until the user has stopped
  typing for a certain amount of time before sending the request. This ensures
  that you only send one request for a given input, even if the user types
  quickly.
- "Cancelling" requests. This means that you cancel a request if the user
  navigates away from the page before the request completes. This ensures that
  you don't waste time processing a response that the user will never see.

In Riverpod, both of these techniques can be implemented in a similar way.
The key is to use `ref.onDispose` combined with "automatic disposal" or `ref.watch`
to achieve the desired behavior.

To showcase this, we will make a simple application with two pages:

- A home screen, with a button which opens a new page
- A detail page, which displays a random activity from the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/),
  with the ability to refresh the activity.  
  See <Link documentID="how_to/pull_to_refresh" /> for information
  on how to implement pull-to-refresh.

We will then implement the following behaviors:

- If the user opens the detail page and then navigates back immediately,
  we will cancel the request for the activity.
- If the user refreshes the activity multiple times in a row, we will debounce
  the requests so that we only send one request after the user stops refreshing.

## The application

<img
  src="/img/how_to/cancel/app.gif"
  alt="Gif showcasing the application, opening the detail page and refreshing the activity."
/>

First, let's create the application, without any debouncing or cancelling.  
We won't use anything fancy here, and stick to a plain `FloatingActionButton` with
a `Navigator.push` to open the detail page.

First, let's start with defining our home screen. As usual,
let's not forget to specify a `ProviderScope` at the root of our application.

      home: const ActivityView(),
    );
  }
}

class ActivityView extends ConsumerWidget {
  const ActivityView({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Home screen')),
      body: const Center(
        child: Text('Click the button to open the detail page'),
      ),
      floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton(
        onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pushNamed('/detail-page'),
        child: const Icon(Icons.add),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```


Then, let's define our detail page.
To fetch the activity and implement pull-to-refresh, refer
to the <Link documentID="how_to/pull_to_refresh" /> case study.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

/* SNIPPET START */
class Activity {
  Activity({
    required this.activity,
    required this.type,
    required this.participants,
    required this.price,
  });

  factory Activity.fromJson(Map<Object?, Object?> json) {
    return Activity(
      activity: json['activity']! as String,
      type: json['type']! as String,
      participants: json['participants']! as int,
      price: json['price']! as double,
    );
  }

  final String activity;
  final String type;
  final int participants;
  final double price;
}

final activityProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<Activity>((ref) async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.https('www.boredapi.com', '/api/activity'),
  );

  final json = jsonDecode(response.body) as Map;
  return Activity.fromJson(json);
});

class DetailPageView extends ConsumerWidget {
  const DetailPageView({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final activity = ref.watch(activityProvider);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(
        title: const Text('Detail page'),
      ),
      body: RefreshIndicator(
        onRefresh: () => ref.refresh(activityProvider.future),
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            switch (activity) {
              AsyncValue(:final value?) => Text(value.activity),
              AsyncValue(:final error?) => Text('Error: $error'),
              _ => const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),
            },
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```


## Cancelling requests

Now that we have a working application, let's implement the cancellation logic.

To do so, we will use `ref.onDispose` to cancel the request when the user
navigates away from the page. For this to work, it is important that the
automatic disposal of providers is enabled.

The exact code needed to cancel the request will depend on the HTTP client.
In this example, we will use `package:http`, but the same principle applies
to other clients.

The key here is that `ref.onDispose` will be called when the user navigates away.
That is because our provider is no-longer used, and therefore disposed
thanks to automatic disposal.  
We can therefore use this callback to cancel the request. When using `package:http`,
this can be done by closing our HTTP client.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import '../detail_screen/codegen.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
final activityProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<Activity>((ref) async {
  // {@template client}
  // We create an HTTP client using package:http
  // {@endtemplate}
  final client = http.Client();
  // {@template onDispose}
  // On dispose, we close the client.
  // This will cancel any pending request that the client might have.
  // {@endtemplate}
  ref.onDispose(client.close);

  // {@template get}
  // We now use the client to make the request instead of the "get" function.
  // {@endtemplate}
  final response = await client.get(
    Uri.https('www.boredapi.com', '/api/activity'),
  );

  // {@template jsonDecode}
  // The rest of the code is the same as before
  // {@endtemplate}
  final json = jsonDecode(response.body) as Map;
  return Activity.fromJson(Map.from(json));
});
/* SNIPPET END */

```


## Debouncing requests

Now that we have implemented cancellation, let's implement debouncing.  
At the moment, if the user refreshes the activity multiple times in a row,
we will send a request for each refresh.

Technically speaking, now that we have implemented cancellation, this is not
a problem. If the user refreshes the activity multiple times in a row,
the previous request will be cancelled, when a new request is made.

However, this is not ideal. We are still sending multiple requests, and
wasting bandwidth and server resources.  
What we could instead do is delay our requests until the user stops refreshing
the activity for a fixed amount of time.

The logic here is very similar to the cancellation logic. We will again
use `ref.onDispose`. However, the idea here is that instead of
closing an HTTP client, we will rely on `onDispose` to abort the request
before it starts.  
We will then arbitrarily wait for 500ms before sending the request.
Then, if the user refreshes the activity again before the 500ms have elapsed,
`onDispose` will be invoked, aborting the request.

:::info
To abort requests, a common practice is to voluntarily throw.  
It is safe to throw inside providers after the provider has been disposed.
The exception will naturally be caught by Riverpod and be ignored.
:::


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

import '../detail_screen/codegen.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
final activityProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<Activity>((ref) async {
  // {@template didDispose}
  // We capture whether the provider is currently disposed or not.
  // {@endtemplate}
  var didDispose = false;
  ref.onDispose(() => didDispose = true);

  // {@template delayed}
  // We delay the request by 500ms, to wait for the user to stop refreshing.
  // {@endtemplate}
  await Future<void>.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 500));

  // {@template cancelled}
  // If the provider was disposed during the delay, it means that the user
  // refreshed again. We throw an exception to cancel the request.
  // It is safe to use an exception here, as it will be caught by Riverpod.
  // {@endtemplate}
  if (didDispose) {
    throw Exception('Cancelled');
  }

  // {@template http}
  // The following code is unchanged from the previous snippet
  // {@endtemplate}
  final client = http.Client();
  ref.onDispose(client.close);

  final response = await client.get(
    Uri.https('www.boredapi.com', '/api/activity'),
  );

  final json = jsonDecode(response.body) as Map;
  return Activity.fromJson(Map.from(json));
});
/* SNIPPET END */

```


## Going further: Doing both at once

We now know how to debounce and cancel requests.  
But currently, if we want to do another request, we need to copy-paste
the same logic in multiple places. This is not ideal.

However, we can go further and implement a reusable utility to do both at once.

The idea here is to implement an extension method on `Ref` that will
handle both cancellation and debouncing in a single method.


> **Snippet: extension.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

/* SNIPPET START */
extension DebounceAndCancelExtension on Ref {
  // {@template note}
  /// Wait for [duration] (defaults to 500ms), and then return a [http.Client]
  /// which can be used to make a request.
  ///
  /// That client will automatically be closed when the provider is disposed.
  // {@endtemplate}
  Future<http.Client> getDebouncedHttpClient([Duration? duration]) async {
    // {@template didDispose}
    // First, we handle debouncing.
    // {@endtemplate}
    var didDispose = false;
    onDispose(() => didDispose = true);

    // {@template delay}
    // We delay the request by 500ms, to wait for the user to stop refreshing.
    // {@endtemplate}
    await Future<void>.delayed(duration ?? const Duration(milliseconds: 500));

    // {@template cancel}
    // If the provider was disposed during the delay, it means that the user
    // refreshed again. We throw an exception to cancel the request.
    // It is safe to use an exception here, as it will be caught by Riverpod.
    // {@endtemplate}
    if (didDispose) {
      throw Exception('Cancelled');
    }

    // {@template client}
    // We now create the client and close it when the provider is disposed.
    // {@endtemplate}
    final client = http.Client();
    onDispose(client.close);

    // {@template return}
    // Finally, we return the client to allow our provider to make the request.
    // {@endtemplate}
    return client;
  }
}

```


We can then use this extension method in our providers as followed:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import '../detail_screen/codegen.dart';
import '../extension.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
final activityProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<Activity>((ref) async {
  // {@template client}
  // We obtain an HTTP client using the extension we created earlier.
  // {@endtemplate}
  final client = await ref.getDebouncedHttpClient();

  // {@template get}
  // We now use the client to make the request instead of the "get" function.
  // Our request will naturally be debounced and be cancelled if the user
  // leaves the page.
  // {@endtemplate}
  final response = await client.get(
    Uri.https('www.boredapi.com', '/api/activity'),
  );

  final json = jsonDecode(response.body) as Map;
  return Activity.fromJson(Map.from(json));
});
/* SNIPPET END */

```




==================================================
FILE: how_to/eager_initialization.mdx
==================================================

---
title: How to eagerly initialize providers
version: 2
---

import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import { AutoSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import consumerExample from "!!raw-loader!./eager_initialization/consumer_example.dart";
import asyncConsumerExample from "!!raw-loader!./eager_initialization/async_consumer_example.dart";
import requireValue from "./eager_initialization/require_value";

All providers are initialized lazily by default. This means that the provider is only
initialized when it is first used. This is useful for providers that are only
used in certain parts of the application.

Unfortunately, there is no way to flag a provider as needing to be eagerly initialized due
to how Dart works (for tree shaking purposes). One solution, however, is to forcibly
read the providers you want to eagerly initialize at the root of your application.

The recommended approach is to simply "watch" a provider in a Consumer placed right under your `ProviderScope`:


> **Snippet: consumer_example.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: use_key_in_widget_constructors

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

final myProvider = Provider<int>((ref) => 0);

/* SNIPPET START */
void main() {
  runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return const _EagerInitialization(
      // {@template render}
      // TODO: Render your app here
      // {@endtemplate}
      child: MaterialApp(),
    );
  }
}

class _EagerInitialization extends ConsumerWidget {
  const _EagerInitialization({required this.child});
  final Widget child;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    // {@template watch}
    // Eagerly initialize providers by watching them.
    // By using "watch", the provider will stay alive and not be disposed.
    // {@endtemplate}
    ref.watch(myProvider);
    return child;
  }
}
/* SNIPPET END */

```


:::note
Consider putting the initialization consumer in your "MyApp" or in a public widget.
This enables your tests to use the same behavior, by removing logic from your main.
:::

### FAQ

#### Won't this rebuild our entire application when the provider changes?

No, this is not the case.
In the sample given above, the consumer responsible for eagerly initializing
is a separate widget, which does nothing but return a `child`.

The key part is that it returns a `child`, rather than instantiating `MaterialApp` itself.
This means that if `_EagerInitialization` ever rebuilds, the `child` variable
will not have changed. And when a widget doesn't change, Flutter doesn't rebuild it.

As such, only `_EagerInitialization` will rebuild, unless another widget is also listening to that provider.

#### Using this approach, how can I handle loading and error states?

You can handle loading/error states as you normally would in a `Consumer`.
Your `_EagerInitialization` could check if a provider is in a "loading" state,
and if so, return a `CircularProgressIndicator` instead of the `child`:


> **Snippet: async_consumer_example.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unused_element

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

final myProvider = FutureProvider<int>((ref) => 0);

/* SNIPPET START */
class _EagerInitialization extends ConsumerWidget {
  const _EagerInitialization({required this.child});
  final Widget child;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final result = ref.watch(myProvider);

    // {@template states}
    // Handle error states and loading states
    // {@endtemplate}
    if (result.isLoading) {
      return const CircularProgressIndicator();
    } else if (result.hasError) {
      return const Text('Oopsy!');
    }

    return child;
  }
}
/* SNIPPET END */

```


#### I've handled loading/error states, but other Consumers still receive an AsyncValue! Is there a way to not have to handle loading/error states in every widget?

Rather than trying to have your provider _not_ expose an `AsyncValue`, you can
instead have your widgets use `AsyncValue.requireValue`.  
This will read the data without having to do pattern matching. And in case a bug slips through,
it will throw an exception with a clear message.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async, use_key_in_widget_constructors

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
// {@template provider}
// An eagerly initialized provider.
// {@endtemplate}
final exampleProvider = FutureProvider<String>((ref) async => 'Hello world');

class MyConsumer extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final result = ref.watch(exampleProvider);

    // {@template note}
    /// If the provider was correctly eagerly initialized, then we can
    /// directly read the data with "requireValue".
    // {@endtemplate}
    return Text(result.requireValue);
  }
}

/* SNIPPET END */

```


:::note
Although there are ways to not expose the loading/error states in those cases (relying on scoping),
it is generally discouraged to do so.  
The added complexity of making two providers and using overrides is not worth the trouble.

title: Testing your providers

import { AutoSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import unitTest from "!!raw-loader!./testing/unit_test.dart";
import widgetTest from "!!raw-loader!./testing/widget_test.dart";
import fullWidgetTest from "!!raw-loader!./testing/full_widget_test.dart";

import notifierMock from "./testing/notifier_mock";
import notifierUsage from "!!raw-loader!./testing/notifier_usage.dart";

A core part of the Riverpod API is the ability to test your providers in isolation.

For a proper test suite, there are a few challenges to overcome:

- Tests should not share state. This means that new tests should
  not be affected by the previous tests.
- Tests should give us the ability to mock certain functionalities
  to achieve the desired state.
- The test environment should be as close as possible to the real
  environment.

Fortunately, Riverpod makes it easy to achieve all of these goals.

## Setting up a test

When defining a test with Riverpod, there are two main scenarios:

- Unit tests, usually with no Flutter dependency.
  This can be useful for testing the behavior of a provider in isolation.
- Widget tests, usually with a Flutter dependency.
  This can be useful for testing the behavior of a widget that uses a provider.

### Unit tests

Unit tests are defined using the `test` function from [package:test](https://pub.dev/packages/test).

The main difference with any other test is that we will want to create
a `ProviderContainer` object. This object will enable our test to interact
with providers.

A typical test using `ProviderContainer` will look like:


> **Snippet: unit_test.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

final provider = Provider((_) => 42);

/* SNIPPET START */
void main() {
  test('Some description', () {
    // {@template container}
    // Create a ProviderContainer for this test.
    // DO NOT share ProviderContainers between tests.
    // {@endtemplate}
    final container = ProviderContainer.test();

    // {@template useProvider}
    // TODO: use the container to test your application.
    // {@endtemplate}
    expect(
      container.read(provider),
      equals('some value'),
    );
  });
}

```


Now that we have a ProviderContainer, we can use it to read providers using:

- `container.read`, to read the current value of a provider.
- `container.listen`, to listen to a provider and be notified of changes.

:::caution
Be careful when using `container.read` when providers are automatically disposed.  
If your provider is not listened to, chances are that its state will get destroyed
in the middle of your test.

In that case, consider using `container.listen`.  
Its return value enables reading the current value of provider anyway,
but will also ensure that the provider is not disposed in the middle of your test:


> **Snippet: auto_dispose_listen.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

final provider = Provider((_) => 'Hello world');

void main() {
  test('Some description', () {
    final container = ProviderContainer.test();
    /* SNIPPET START */
    final subscription = container.listen<String>(provider, (_, _) {});

    expect(
      // {@template read}
      // Equivalent to `container.read(provider)`
      // But the provider will not be disposed unless "subscription" is disposed.
      // {@endtemplate}
      subscription.read(),
      'Some value',
    );
    /* SNIPPET END */
  });
}

```

:::

### Widget tests

Widget tests are defined using the `testWidgets` function from [package:flutter_test](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_test).

In this case, the main difference with usual Widget tests is that we must add
a `ProviderScope` widget at the root of `tester.pumpWidget`:


> **Snippet: widget_test.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

class YourWidgetYouWantToTest extends StatelessWidget {
  const YourWidgetYouWantToTest({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => const Placeholder();
}

/* SNIPPET START */
void main() {
  testWidgets('Some description', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      const ProviderScope(child: YourWidgetYouWantToTest()),
    );
  });
}
/* SNIPPET END */

```


This is similar to what we do when we enable Riverpod in our Flutter app.

Then, we can use `tester` to interact with our widget.
Alternatively if you want to interact with providers, you can obtain
a `ProviderContainer`.
One can be obtained using `tester.container()`.  
By using `tester`, we can therefore write the following:


> **Snippet: tester_container.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Some description', (tester) async {
    /* SNIPPET START */
    final container = tester.container();
    /* SNIPPET END */
  });
}

```


We can then use it to read providers. Here's a full example:


> **Snippet: full_widget_test.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

final provider = Provider((_) => 'some value');

class YourWidgetYouWantToTest extends StatelessWidget {
  const YourWidgetYouWantToTest({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => const Placeholder();
}

/* SNIPPET START */
void main() {
  testWidgets('Some description', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      const ProviderScope(child: YourWidgetYouWantToTest()),
    );

    final container = tester.container();

    // {@template useProvider}
    // TODO interact with your providers
    // {@endtemplate}
    expect(
      container.read(provider),
      'some value',
    );
  });
}
/* SNIPPET END */

```


## Mocking providers

So far, we've seen how to set up a test and basic interactions with providers.
However, in some cases, we may want to mock a provider.

The cool part: All providers can be mocked by default, without any additional setup.  
This is possible by specifying the `overrides` parameter on either
`ProviderScope` or `ProviderContainer`.

Consider the following provider:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async

import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
// {@template provider}
// An eagerly initialized provider.
// {@endtemplate}
final exampleProvider = FutureProvider<String>((ref) async => 'Hello world');
/* SNIPPET END */

```


We can mock it using:


> **Snippet: mock_provider.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';

import 'full_widget_test.dart';
import 'provider_to_mock/raw.dart';

void main() {
  testWidgets('Some description', (tester) async {
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      const ProviderScope(child: YourWidgetYouWantToTest()),
    );
    /* SNIPPET START */
    // {@template container}
    // In unit tests, by reusing our previous "createContainer" utility.
    // {@endtemplate}
    final container = ProviderContainer.test(
      // {@template providers}
      // We can specify a list of providers to mock:
      // {@endtemplate}
      overrides: [
        // {@template exampleProvider}
        // In this case, we are mocking "exampleProvider".
        // {@endtemplate}
        exampleProvider.overrideWith((ref) {
          // {@template note}
          // This function is the typical initialization function of a provider.
          // This is where you normally call "ref.watch" and return the initial state.

          // Let's replace the default "Hello world" with a custom value.
          // Then, interacting with `exampleProvider` will return this value.
          // {@endtemplate}
          return 'Hello from tests';
        }),
      ],
    );

    // {@template providerScope}
    // We can also do the same thing in widget tests using ProviderScope:
    // {@endtemplate}
    await tester.pumpWidget(
      ProviderScope(
        // {@template overrides}
        // ProviderScopes have the exact same "overrides" parameter
        // {@endtemplate}
        overrides: [
          // {@template sameAsBefore}
          // Same as before
          // {@endtemplate}
          exampleProvider.overrideWith((ref) => 'Hello from tests'),
        ],
        child: const YourWidgetYouWantToTest(),
      ),
    );
    /* SNIPPET END */
  });
}

```


## Spying on changes in a provider

Since we obtained a `ProviderContainer` in our tests, it is possible to
use it to "listen" to a provider:


> **Snippet: listen_provider.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: avoid_print

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

final provider = Provider((_) => 'Hello world');

void main() {
  test('Some description', () {
    final container = ProviderContainer.test();
    /* SNIPPET START */
    container.listen<String>(
      provider,
      (previous, next) {
        print('The provider changed from $previous to $next');
      },
    );
    /* SNIPPET END */
  });
}

```


You can then combine this with packages such as [mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito)
or [mocktail](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) to use their `verify` API.  
Or more simply, you can add all changes in a list and assert on it.

## Awaiting asynchronous providers

In Riverpod, it is very common for providers to return a Future/Stream.  
In that case, chances are that our tests need to await for that asynchronous operation
to be completed.

One way to do so is to read the `.future` of a provider:


> **Snippet: await_future.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_async

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

final provider = FutureProvider((_) async => 42);

    // {@endtemplate}

      // {@template read}
      // We read "provider.future" instead of "provider".
      // This is possible on asynchronous providers, and returns a future
      // which will resolve with the value of the provider.
      // {@endtemplate}
      container.read(provider.future),
      // {@template completion}
      // We can verify that the future resolves with the expected value.
      // Alternatively we can use "throwsA" for errors.
      // {@endtemplate}
      completion('some value'),
    );
    /* SNIPPET END */
  });
}

```


## Mocking Notifiers

It is generally discouraged to mock Notifiers. This is because Notifiers cannot be
instantiated on their own, and only work when used as part of a Provider.

Instead, you should likely introduce a level of abstraction in the logic of your
Notifier, such that you can mock that abstraction.
For instance, rather than mocking a Notifier, you could mock a "repository"
that the Notifier uses to fetch data from.

If you insist on mocking a Notifier, there is a special consideration
to create such a mock: Your mock must subclass the original Notifier
base class: You cannot "implement" Notifier, as this would break the interface.

As such, when mocking a Notifier, instead of writing the following mockito code:

```dart
class MyNotifierMock with Mock implements MyNotifier {}
```

You should instead write:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart

import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:mockito/mockito.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() => throw UnimplementedError();
}

// {@template mock}
// Your mock needs to subclass the Notifier base-class corresponding
// to whatever your notifier uses
// {@endtemplate}
class MyNotifierMock extends Notifier<int> with Mock implements MyNotifier {}
/* SNIPPET END */

```


:::info
If using code-generation, for the above to work, your mock will have to
be placed in the same file as the Notifier you are mocking.
Otherwise you would not have access to the `_$MyNotifier` class.

Then, to use your notifier you could do:


> **Snippet: notifier_usage.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

import 'notifier_mock/codegen.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
void main() {
  test('Some description', () {
    final container = ProviderContainer.test(
      // {@template overrides}
      // Override the provider to have it create our mock Notifier.
      // {@endtemplate}
      overrides: [myProvider.overrideWith(MyNotifierMock.new)],
    );

    // {@template readNotifier}
    // Then obtain the mocked notifier through the container:
    // {@endtemplate}
    final notifier = container.read(myProvider.notifier);

    // {@template interactNotifier}
    // You can then interact with the notifier as you would with the real one:
    // {@endtemplate}
    notifier.state = 42;
  });
}

```

title: Implementing pull-to-refresh

import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import { AutoSnippet, When } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import activity from "./pull_to_refresh/activity";
import fetchActivity from "./pull_to_refresh/fetch_activity";
import displayActivity from "!!raw-loader!./pull_to_refresh/display_activity.dart";

import displayActivity4 from "!!raw-loader!./pull_to_refresh/display_activity4.dart";
import fullApp from "./pull_to_refresh/full_app";

Riverpod natively supports pull-to-refresh thanks to its declarative nature.

In general, pull-to-refreshes can be complex due as there are multiple
problems to solve:

- Upon first entering a page, we want to show a spinner.
  But during refresh, we want to show the refresh indicator instead.
  We shouldn't show both the refresh indicator _and_ spinner.
- While a refresh is pending, we want to show the previous data/error.
- We need to show the refresh indicator for as long as the refresh is happening.

Let's see how to solve this using Riverpod.  
For this, we will make a simple example which recommends a random activity to users.  
And doing a pull-to-refresh will trigger a new suggestion:

<img
  alt="A gif of the previously described application working"
  src="/img/how_to/pull_to_refresh/app.gif"
/>

## Making a bare-bones application.

Before implement a pull-to-refresh, we first need something to refresh.  
We can make a simple application which uses [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/)
to suggests a random activity to users.

First, let's define an `Activity` class:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
/* SNIPPET START */
class Activity {
  Activity({
    required this.activity,
    required this.type,
    required this.participants,
    required this.price,
  });

  factory Activity.fromJson(Map<Object?, Object?> json) {
    return Activity(
      activity: json['activity']! as String,
      type: json['type']! as String,
      participants: json['participants']! as int,
      price: json['price']! as double,
    );
  }

  final String activity;
  final String type;
  final int participants;
  final double price;
}
/* SNIPPET END */

```


That class will be responsible for representing a suggested activity
in a type-safe manner, and handle JSON encoding/decoding.  
Using Freezed/json_serializable is not required, but it is recommended.

Now, we'll want to define a provider making a HTTP GET request to fetch
a single activity:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

import '../activity/raw.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
final activityProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<Activity>((ref) async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.https('www.boredapi.com', '/api/activity'),
  );

  final json = jsonDecode(response.body) as Map;
  return Activity.fromJson(json);
});
/* SNIPPET END */

```


We can now use this provider to display a random activity.  
For now, we will not handle the loading/error state, and simply
display the activity when available:


> **Snippet: display_activity.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: use_key_in_widget_constructors

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import 'fetch_activity/codegen.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class ActivityView extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final activity = ref.watch(activityProvider);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Pull to refresh')),
      body: Center(
        // {@template render}
        // If we have an activity, display it, otherwise wait
        // {@endtemplate}
        child: Text(activity.value?.activity ?? ''),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```


## Adding `RefreshIndicator`

Now that we have a simple application, we can add a `RefreshIndicator` to it.  
That widget is an official Material widget responsible for displaying a refresh indicator
when the user pulls down the screen.

Using `RefreshIndicator` requires a scrollable surface. But so far, we don't have
any. We can fix that by using a `ListView`/`GridView`/`SingleChildScrollView`/etc:


> **Snippet: display_activity2.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: avoid_print, use_key_in_widget_constructors

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import 'fetch_activity/codegen.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class ActivityView extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final activity = ref.watch(activityProvider);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Pull to refresh')),
      /* highlight-start */
      body: RefreshIndicator(
        onRefresh: () async => print('refresh'),
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            /* highlight-end */
            Text(activity.value?.activity ?? ''),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```


Users can now pull down the screen. But our data isn't refreshed yet.

## Adding the refresh logic

When users pull down the screen, `RefreshIndicator` will invoke
the `onRefresh` callback. We can use that callback to refresh our data.
In there, we can use `ref.refresh` to refresh the provider of our choice.

**Note**: `onRefresh` is expected to return a `Future`.
And it is important for that future to complete when the refresh is done.

To obtain such a future, we can read our provider's `.future` property.
This will return a future which completes when our provider has resolved.

We can therefore update our `RefreshIndicator` to look like this:


> **Snippet: display_activity3.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: use_key_in_widget_constructors

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import 'fetch_activity/codegen.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class ActivityView extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final activity = ref.watch(activityProvider);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Pull to refresh')),
      body: RefreshIndicator(
        // {@template onRefresh}
        // By refreshing "activityProvider.future", and returning that result,
        // the refresh indicator will keep showing until the new activity is
        // fetched.
        // {@endtemplate}
        /* highlight-start */
        onRefresh: () => ref.refresh(activityProvider.future),
        /* highlight-end */
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            Text(activity.value?.activity ?? ''),
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```


## Showing a spinner only during initial load and handling errors.

At the moment, our UI does not handle the error/loading states.  
Instead the data magically pops up when the loading/refresh is done.

Let's change this by gracefully handling those states. There are two
cases:

- During the initial load, we want to show a full-screen spinner.
- During a refresh, we want to show the refresh indicator
  and the previous data/error.

Fortunately, when listening to an asynchronous provider in Riverpod,
Riverpod gives us an `AsyncValue`, which offers everything we need.

That `AsyncValue` can then be combined with Dart 3.0's pattern matching
as follows:


> **Snippet: display_activity4.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: use_key_in_widget_constructors

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

import 'activity/codegen.dart';
import 'fetch_activity/codegen.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class ActivityView extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    final activity = ref.watch(activityProvider);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Pull to refresh')),
      body: RefreshIndicator(
        onRefresh: () => ref.refresh(activityProvider.future),
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            switch (activity) {
              // {@template data}
              // If some data is available, we display it.
              // Note that data will still be available during a refresh.
              // {@endtemplate}
              AsyncValue<Activity>(:final value?) => Text(value.activity),
              // {@template error}
              // An error is available, so we render it.
              // {@endtemplate}
              AsyncValue(:final error?) => Text('Error: $error'),
              // {@template loading}
              // No data/error, so we're in loading state.
              // {@endtemplate}
              _ => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
            },
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```


:::caution
We use `valueOrNull` here, as currently, using `value` throws
if in error/loading state.

Riverpod 3.0 will change this to have `value` behave like `valueOrNull`.
But for now, let's stick to `valueOrNull`.
:::

:::tip
Notice the usage of the `:final valueOrNull?` syntax in our pattern matching.
This syntax can be used only because `activityProvider` returns a non-nullable
`Activity`.

If your data can be `null`, you can instead use `AsyncValue(hasData: true, :final valueOrNull)`.
This will correctly handle cases where the data is `null`, at the cost of
a few extra characters.
:::

## Wrapping up: full application

Here is the combined source of everything we've covered so far:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: use_key_in_widget_constructors, unreachable_from_main

/* SNIPPET START */

void main() => runApp(ProviderScope(child: MyApp()));

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {

  }
}

class ActivityView extends ConsumerWidget {

    final activity = ref.watch(activityProvider);

    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Pull to refresh')),
      body: RefreshIndicator(
        onRefresh: () => ref.refresh(activityProvider.future),
        child: ListView(
          children: [
            switch (activity) {
              AsyncValue<Activity>(:final value?) => Text(value.activity),
              AsyncValue(:final error?) => Text('Error: $error'),
              _ => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
            },
          ],
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

final activityProvider = FutureProvider.autoDispose<Activity>((ref) async {
  final response = await http.get(
    Uri.https('www.boredapi.com', '/api/activity'),
  );

  final json = jsonDecode(response.body) as Map;
  return Activity.fromJson(json);
});

class Activity {
  Activity({
    required this.activity,
    required this.type,
    required this.participants,
    required this.price,
  });

  factory Activity.fromJson(Map<Object?, Object?> json) {
    return Activity(
      activity: json['activity']! as String,
      type: json['type']! as String,
      participants: json['participants']! as int,
      price: json['price']! as double,
    );
  }

  final String activity;
  final String type;
  final int participants;
  final double price;
}

title: How to reduce provider/widget rebuilds
version: 1
---

import { AutoSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import select from "./select/select";
import selectAsync from "./select/select_async";

With everything we've seen so far, we can already build a fully functional
application. However, you may have questions regarding performance.

In this page, we will cover a few tips and tricks to possibly optimize your code.

:::caution
Before doing any optimization, make sure to benchmark your application.
The added complexity of the optimizations may not be worth minor gains.
:::

## Filtering widget/provider rebuild using "select".

You may have noticed that, by default, using `ref.watch` causes
consumers/providers to rebuild whenever _any_ of the properties of an
object changes.  
For instance, watching a `User` and only using its "name" will still cause
the consumer to rebuild if the "age" changes.

But in case you have a consumer using only a subset of the properties,
you want to avoid rebuilding the widget when the other properties change.

This can be achieved by using the `select` functionality of providers.  
When doing so, `ref.watch` will no-longer return the full object,
but rather the selected properties.  
And your consumers/providers will now rebuild only if those selected
properties change.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: avoid_multiple_declarations_per_line, omit_local_variable_types, prefer_final_locals, use_key_in_widget_constructors

import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class User {
  late String firstName, lastName;
}

final provider = Provider(
  (ref) => User()
    ..firstName = 'John'
    ..lastName = 'Doe',
);

class ConsumerExample extends ConsumerWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
    // {@template watch}
    // Instead of writing:
    // String name = ref.watch(provider).firstName!;
    // We can write:
    // {@endtemplate}
    String name = ref.watch(provider.select((it) => it.firstName));
    // {@template note}
    // This will cause the widget to only listen to changes on "firstName".
    // {@endtemplate}

    return Text('Hello $name');
  }
}
/* SNIPPET END */

```


:::info
It is possible to call `select` as many times as you wish.
You are free to call it once per property you desire.
:::

:::caution
The selected properties are expected to be immutable.
Returning a `List` and then mutating that list will not trigger a rebuild.
:::

:::caution
Using `select` slightly slows down individual read operations and
increases the complexity of your code by a tiny bit.
It may not be worth using it if those "other properties"
rarely change.
:::

### Selecting asynchronous properties

In case you are trying to optimize a provider listening to another provider,
chances are that other provider is asynchronous.

Normally, you would `ref.watch(anotherProvider.future)` to get the value.  
The issue is, `select` will apply on an `AsyncValue` – which is not something
you can await.

For this purpose, you can instead use `selectAsync`. It is unique to asynchronous
code, and enables performing a `select` operation on the data emitted by a provider.  
Its usage is similar to that of `select`, but returns a `Future` instead:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable, avoid_multiple_declarations_per_line

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

class User {
  late String firstName, lastName;
}

final userProvider = FutureProvider(
  (ref) => User()
    ..firstName = 'John'
    ..lastName = 'Doe',
);
/* SNIPPET START */
final provider = FutureProvider((ref) async {
  // {@template watch}
  // Wait for a user to be available, and listen to only the "firstName" property
  // {@endtemplate}
  final firstName = await ref.watch(
    userProvider.selectAsync((it) => it.firstName),
  );

  // {@template todo}
  // TODO use "firstName" to fetch something else
  // {@endtemplate}
});
/* SNIPPET END */

```

Code generation is the idea of using a tool to generate code for us.
In Dart, it comes with the downside of requiring an extra step to "compile"
an application. Although this problem may be solved in the near future, as the
Dart team is working on a potential solution to this problem.

In the context of Riverpod, code generation is about slightly changing the syntax
for defining a "provider". For example, instead of:

<CodeBlock language="dart">{trimSnippet(rawFetchUser)}</CodeBlock>

Using code generation, we would write:

<CodeBlock language="dart">{trimSnippet(fetchUser)}</CodeBlock>

When using Riverpod, code generation is completely optional. It is entirely possible
to use Riverpod without.
At the same time, Riverpod embraces code generation and recommends using it.

For information on how to install and use Riverpod's code generator, refer to
the <Link documentID="introduction/getting_started"/> page. Make sure to enable code generation
in the documentation's sidebar.

## Should I use code generation?

Code generation is optional in Riverpod.
With that in mind, you may wonder if you should use it or not.

The answer is: **Only if you already use code-generation for other things**. (cf Freezed, json_serializable, etc.)  
When the Dart team was working on a feature called "macros", using code generation
was the recommended way to use Riverpod. Unfortunately, those have been cancelled.

While code-generation brings many benefits, it currently is still fairly slow.
The Dart team is working on improving the performance of code generation,
but it is unclear when that will be available and how much it will improve.
As such, if you are not already using code generation in your project, it is
probably not worth it to start using it just for Riverpod.

At the same time, many applications already use code generation with packages such
as [Freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) or [json_serializable](https://pub.dev/packages/json_serializable).
In that case, your project probably is already set up for code generation, and
using Riverpod should be simple.

## What are the benefits of using code generation?

You may be wondering: "If code generation is optional in Riverpod, why use it?"

As always with packages: To make your life easier.
This includes but is not limited to:

- Better syntax, more readable/flexible, and with a reduced learning curve.
  - No need to worry about the type of provider. Write your logic,
    and Riverpod will pick the most suitable provider for you.
  - The syntax no longer looks like we're defining a "dirty global variable".
    Instead we are defining a custom function/class.
  - Passing parameters to providers is now unrestricted. Instead of being limited to
    using <Link documentID="concepts2/family"/> and passing a single positional parameter,
    you can now pass any parameter. This includes named parameters, optional ones,
    and even default values.
- **Stateful hot-reload** of the code written in Riverpod.
- Better debugging, through the generation of extra metadata that the debugger then picks up.

## The Syntax

### Defining a provider:

When defining a provider using code generation, it is helpful to keep in mind the following points:

- Providers can be defined either as an annotated <span style={BLUE_STYLE}>function</span> or
  as an annotated <span style={BLUE_STYLE}>class</span>. They are pretty much the same,
  but Class-based provider has the advantage of including public methods that enable
  external objects to modify the state of the provider (side-effects). Functional providers

- All Dart <span style={RED_STYLE}>async</span> primitives (Future, FutureOr, and Stream) are supported.
- When a function is marked as <span style={RED_STYLE}>async</span>, the provider automatically handles
  errors/loading states and exposes an AsyncValue.

### Enabling/disable autoDispose:

When using code generation, providers are autoDispose by default. That means that they will automatically
dispose of themselves when there are no listeners attached to them (ref.watch/ref.listen).  
This default setting better aligns with Riverpod's philosophy. Initially with the non-code generation variant,
autoDispose was off by default to accommodate users migrating from `package:provider`.

If you want to disable autoDispose, you can do so by passing `keepAlive: true` to the annotation.

<CodeBlock language="dart">{trimSnippet(autoDisposeCodeGen)}</CodeBlock>

### Passing parameters to a provider (family):

When using code generation, we no-longer need to rely on the `family` modifier to pass parameters to a provider.
Instead, the main function of our provider can accept any number of parameters, including named, optional, or default values.  
Do note however that these parameters should still have a consistent ==.
Meaning either the values should be cached, or the parameters should override ==.

## Migrate from non-code-generation variant:

When using non-code-generation variant, it is necessary to manually determine the type of your provider.
The following are the corresponding options for transitioning into code-generation variant:

import hookConsumer from "!!raw-loader!./about_hooks/hook_consumer.dart";

import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";

This page explains what hooks are and how they are related to Riverpod.

"Hooks" are utilities common from a separate package, independent from Riverpod:
[flutter_hooks].  
Although [flutter_hooks] is a completely separate package and does not have anything
to do with Riverpod (at least directly), it is common to pair Riverpod
and [flutter_hooks] together.

## Should you use hooks?

Hooks are a powerful tool, but they are not for everyone.  
If you are a newcomer to Riverpod, **avoid using hooks**.

Although useful, hooks are not necessary for Riverpod.  
You shouldn't start using hooks because of Riverpod. Rather, you should start
using hooks because you want to use hooks.

Using hooks is a tradeoff. They can be great for producing robust and reusable
code, but they are also a new concept to learn, and they can be confusing at first.
Hooks aren't a core Flutter concept. As such, they will feel out of place in Flutter/Dart.

## What are hooks?

Hooks are functions used inside widgets. They are designed as an alternative
to [StatefulWidget]s, to make logic more reusable and composable.

Hooks are a concept coming from [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [flutter_hooks]
is merely a port of the React implementation to Flutter.  
As such, yes, hooks may feel a bit out of place in Flutter. Ideally,
in the future we would have a solution to the problem that hooks solves,
designed specifically for Flutter.

If Riverpod's providers are for "global" application state, hooks are for
local widget state. Hooks are typically used for dealing with stateful UI objects,
such as [TextEditingController](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/TextEditingController-class.html),
[AnimationController](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html).  
They can also serve as a replacement to the "builder" pattern, replacing widgets
such as [FutureBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/FutureBuilder-class.html)/[TweenAnimatedBuilder](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/TweenAnimationBuilder-class.html)
by an alternative that does not involve "nesting" – drastically improving readability.

In general, hooks are helpful for:

- Forms
- Animations
- Reacting to user events
- etc.

As an example, we could use hooks to manually implement a fade-in animation,
where a widget starts invisible and slowly appears.

If we were to use [StatefulWidget], the code would look like this:

```dart
class FadeIn extends StatefulWidget {
  const FadeIn({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);

  final Widget child;

  @override
  State<FadeIn> createState() => _FadeInState();
}

class _FadeInState extends State<FadeIn> with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin {
  late final AnimationController animationController = AnimationController(
    vsync: this,
    duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
  );

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    animationController.forward();
  }

  @override
  void dispose() {
    animationController.dispose();
    super.dispose();
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AnimatedBuilder(
      animation: animationController,
      builder: (context, child) {
        return Opacity(
          opacity: animationController.value,
          child: widget.child,
        );
      },
    );
  }
}
```

Using hooks, the equivalent would be:

```dart
class FadeIn extends HookWidget {
  const FadeIn({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);

  final Widget child;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    // Create an AnimationController. The controller will automatically be
    // disposed when the widget is unmounted.
    final animationController = useAnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );

    // useEffect is the equivalent of initState + didUpdateWidget + dispose.
    // The callback passed to useEffect is executed the first time the hook is
    // invoked, and then whenever the list passed as second parameter changes.
    // Since we pass an empty const list here, that's strictly equivalent to `initState`.
    useEffect(() {
      // start the animation when the widget is first rendered.
      animationController.forward();
      // We could optionally return some "dispose" logic here
      return null;
    }, const []);

    // Tell Flutter to rebuild this widget when the animation updates.
    // This is equivalent to AnimatedBuilder
    useAnimation(animationController);

    return Opacity(
      opacity: animationController.value,
      child: child,
    );
  }
}
```

There are a few interesting things to note in this code:

- There is no memory leak. This code does not recreate a new `AnimationController` whenever the
  widget rebuilds, and the controller is correctly released when the widget is unmounted.

- It is possible to use hooks as many time as we want within the same widget.
  As such, we can create multiple `AnimationController` if we want:

  ```dart
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final animationController = useAnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );
    final anotherController = useAnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );

    ...
  }
  ```

  This creates two controllers, without any sort of negative consequence.

- If we wanted, we could refactor this logic into a separate reusable function:

  ```dart
  double useFadeIn() {
    final animationController = useAnimationController(
      duration: const Duration(seconds: 2),
    );
    useEffect(() {
      animationController.forward();
      return null;
    }, const []);
    useAnimation(animationController);
    return animationController.value;
  }
  ```

  We could then use this function inside our widgets, as long as that widget is a [HookWidget]:

  ```dart
  class FadeIn extends HookWidget {
    const FadeIn({Key? key, required this.child}) : super(key: key);

    final Widget child;

    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final fade = useFadeIn();

      return Opacity(opacity: fade, child: child);
    }
  }
  ```

  Note how our `useFadeIn` function is completely independent from our
  `FadeIn` widget.  
  If we wanted, we could use that `useFadeIn` function in a completely different
  widget, and it would still work!

## The rules of hooks

Hooks comes with unique constraints:

- They can only be used within the `build` method of a widget that extends [HookWidget]:

  **Good**:

  ```dart
  class Example extends HookWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final controller = useAnimationController();
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  **Bad**:

  ```dart
  // Not a HookWidget
  class Example extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      final controller = useAnimationController();
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  **Bad**:

  ```dart
  class Example extends HookWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return ElevatedButton(
        onPressed: () {
          // Not _actually_ inside the "build" method, but instead inside
          // a user interaction lifecycle (here "on pressed").
          final controller = useAnimationController();
        },
        child: Text('click me'),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

- They cannot be used conditionally or in a loop.

  **Bad**:

  ```dart
  class Example extends HookWidget {
    const Example({required this.condition, super.key});
    final bool condition;
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      if (condition) {
        // Hooks should not be used inside "if"s/"for"s, ...
        final controller = useAnimationController();
      }
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

## Hooks and Riverpod

### Installation

Since hooks are independent from Riverpod, it is necessary to install hooks
separately. If you want to use them, installing [hooks_riverpod] is not
enough. You will still need to add [flutter_hooks] to your dependencies.
See <Link documentID="introduction/getting_started" hash="installing-the-package" />) for more information.

### Usage

In some cases, you may want to write a Widget that uses both hooks and Riverpod.
But as you may have already noticed, both hooks and Riverpod provide their
own custom widget base type: [HookWidget] and [ConsumerWidget].  
But classes can only extend one superclass at a time.

To solve this problem, you can use the [hooks_riverpod] package.
This package provides a [HookConsumerWidget] class that combines both
[HookWidget] and [ConsumerWidget] into a single type.  
You can therefore subclass [HookConsumerWidget] instead of [HookWidget]:

<CodeSnippet snippet={hookConsumerWidget}></CodeSnippet>

Alternatively, you can use the "builders" provided by both packages.  
For example, we could stick to using `StatelessWidget`, and use both
`HookBuilder` and `Consumer`.

<CodeSnippet snippet={hookAndConsumer}></CodeSnippet>

:::note
This approach would work without using [hooks_riverpod]. Only [flutter_riverpod]
is needed.
:::

If you like this approach, [hooks_riverpod] streamlines it by providing [HookConsumer],
which is the combination of both builders in one:

<CodeSnippet snippet={hookConsumer}></CodeSnippet>

import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import { AutoSnippet, When } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";

Here are some commonly asked questions from the community:

## What is the difference between `ref.refresh` and `ref.invalidate`?

You may have noticed that `ref` has two methods to force a provider to recompute,
and wonder how they differ.

It's simpler than you think: `ref.refresh` is nothing but syntax sugar for
`invalidate` + `read`:

```dart
T refresh<T>(provider) {
  invalidate(provider);
  return read(provider);
}
```

If you do not care about the new value of a provider after recomputing it,
then `invalidate` is the way to go.  
If you do, use `refresh` instead.

:::info
This logic is automatically enforced through lint rules.  
If you tried to use `ref.refresh` without using the returned value,
you would get a warning.
:::

The main difference in behavior is by reading the provider right
after invalidating it, the provider **immediately** recomputes.  
Whereas if we call `invalidate` but don't read it right after,
then the update will trigger _later_.

That "later" update is generally at the start of the next frame.
Yet, if a provider that is currently not being listened to is invalidated, 
it will not be updated until it is listened to again.

## Why is there no shared interface between Ref and WidgetRef?

Riverpod voluntarily dissociates `Ref` and `WidgetRef`.  
This is done on purpose to avoid writing code which conditionally
depends on one or the other.

One issue is that `Ref` and `WidgetRef`, although similar looking,
have subtle differences.  
Code relying on both would be unreliable in ways that are difficult to spot.

At the same time, relying on `WidgetRef` is equivalent to relying on `BuildContext`.
It is effectively putting your logic in the UI layer, which is not recommended.

---

Such code should be refactored to **always** use `Ref`.

The solution to this problem is typically to move your logic
into a `Notifier` (see <Link documentID="concepts2/providers" />), 
and then have your logic be a method of that `Notifier`.

This way, when your widgets want to invoke this logic, they can
write something along the lines of:

```dart
ref.read(yourNotifierProvider.notifier).yourMethod();
```

`yourMethod` would use the `Notifier`'s `Ref` to interact with other providers.

## Why do we need to extend ConsumerWidget instead of using the raw StatelessWidget?

This is due to an unfortunate limitation in the API of `InheritedWidget`.

There are a few problems:

- It is not possible to implement an "on change" listener with `InheritedWidget`.
  That means that something such as `ref.listen` cannot be used with `BuildContext`.

  `State.didChangeDependencies` is the closest thing to it, but it is not reliable.
  One issue is that the life-cycle can be triggered even if no dependency changed,
  especially if your widget tree uses GlobalKeys (and some Flutter widgets already do so internally).

- Widgets listening to an `InheritedWidget` never stop listening to it.
  This is usually fine for pure metadata, such as "theme" or "media query".

  For business logic, this is a problem.
  Say you use a provider to represent a paginated API.
  When the page offset changes, you wouldn't want your widget to keep listening
  to the previously visible pages.

- `InheritedWidget` has no way to track when widgets stop listening to them.
  Riverpod sometimes relies on tracking whether or not a provider is being listened to.

This functionality is crucial for both the auto dispose mechanism and the ability to
pass arguments to providers.  
Those features are what make Riverpod so powerful.

Maybe in a distant future, those issues will be fixed. In that case,
Riverpod would migrate to using `BuildContext` instead of `Ref`.
This would enable using `StatelessWidget` instead of `ConsumerWidget`.  
But that's for another time!

## Why doesn't hooks_riverpod export flutter_hooks?

This is to respect good versioning practices.

While you cannot use `hooks_riverpod` without `flutter_hooks`,
both packages are versioned independently. A breaking change could happen
in one but not the other.

## Is there a way to reset all providers at once?

No, there is no way to reset all providers at once.

This is on purpose, as it is considered an anti-pattern. Resetting all providers
at once will often reset providers that you did not intend to reset.

This is commonly asked by users who want to reset the state of their application
when the user logs out.  
If this is what you are after, you should instead have everything dependent on the
user's state to `ref.watch` the "user" provider.

Then, when the user logs out, all providers depending on it would automatically
be reset but everything else would remain untouched.

## I have the error "Using "ref" when a widget is about to or has been unmounted is unsafe." after the widget was disposed", what's wrong?

You might also see "Bad state: No ProviderScope found", which is an older
error message of the same issue.

This error happens when you try to use `ref` in a widget that is no longer
mounted. This generally happens after an `await`:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await future;
    ref.read(...); // May throw "Using "ref" when a widget is about to or has been unmounted is unsafe."
  }
)
```

The solution is to, like with `BuildContext`, check `mounted` before using `ref`:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    await future;
    if (!context.mounted) return;
    ref.read(...); // No longer throws
  }
)
```

import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import { AutoSnippet, When } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";

To ensure good maintainability of your code, here is a list of good practices
you should follow when using Riverpod.

This list is not exhaustive, and is subject to change.  
If you have any suggestions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/issues/new?assignees=rrousselGit&labels=documentation%2C+needs+triage&projects=&template=example_request.md&title=).

Items in this list are not in any particular order.

A good portion of these recommendations can be enforced with [riverpod_lint](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_lint).
See <Link documentID="introduction/getting_started" hash="enabling-riverpod_lintcustom_lint"/>
for installation instructions.

## AVOID initializing providers in a widget

Providers should initialize themselves.  
They should not be initialized by an external element such as a widget.

Failing to do so could cause possible race conditions and unexpected behaviors.

**DON'T**

```dart
class WidgetState extends State<MyWidget> {
  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    // Bad: the provider should initialize itself
    ref.read(provider).init();
  }
}
```

**CONSIDER**

There is no "one-size fits all" solution to this problem.  
If your initialization logic depends on factors external to the provider,
often the correct place to put such logic is in the `onPressed` method of a button
triggering navigation:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    ref.read(provider).init();
    Navigator.of(context).push(...);
  },
  child: Text('Navigate'),
)
```

## AVOID using providers for Ephemeral state.

Providers are designed to be for shared business state.
They are not meant to be used for [Ephemeral state](https://docs.flutter.dev/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/ephemeral-vs-app#ephemeral-state), such as for:

- The currently selected item.
- Form state/
  Because leaving and re-entering the form should typically reset the form state.
  This includes pressing the back button during a multi-page forms.
- Animations.
- Generally everything that Flutter deals with a "controller" (e.g. `TextEditingController`)

If you are looking for a way to handle local widget state, consider using
[flutter_hooks](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_hooks) instead.

One reason why this is discouraged is that such state is often scoped to a route.  
Failing to do so could break your app's back button, due to a new page overriding
the state of a previous page.

For instance say we were to store the currently selected `book` in a provider:

```dart
final selectedBookProvider = StateProvider<String?>((ref) => null);
```
One challenge we could face is, the navigation history could look like:
```
/books
/books/42
/books/21
```

In this scenario, when pressing the back button, we should expect to go back to `/books/42`.
But if we were to use `selectedBookProvider` to store the selected book,
the selected ID would not reset to its previous value, and we would keep seeing `/books/21`.

## DON'T perform side effects during the initialization of a provider

Providers should generally be used to represent a "read" operation.
You should not use them for "write" operations, such as submitting a form.

Using providers for such operations could have unexpected behaviors, such as
skipping a side-effect if a previous one was performed.

If you are looking at a way to handle loading/error states of a side-effect,
see <Link documentID="concepts2/mutations"/>.

**DON'T**:

```dart
final submitProvider = FutureProvider((ref) async {
  final formState = ref.watch(formState);

  // Bad: Providers should not be used for "write" operations.
  return http.post('https://my-api.com', body: formState.toJson());
});
```

## PREFER ref.watch/read/listen (and similar APIs) with statically known providers

Riverpod strongly recommends enabling lint rules (via `riverpod_lint`).  
But for lints to be effective, your code should be written in a way that is
statically analysable.

Failing to do so could make it harder to spot bugs or cause
false positives with lints.

**Do**:

```dart
final provider = Provider((ref) => 42);

...

// OK because the provider is known statically
ref.watch(provider);
```

**Don't**:

```dart
class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
  Example({required this.provider});
  final Provider<int> provider;

  @override
  Widget build(context, ref) {
    // Bad because static analysis cannot know what `provider` is
    ref.watch(provider);
  }
}
```

## AVOID dynamically creating providers

Providers should exclusively be top-level final variables.

**Do**:

```dart
final provider = Provider<String>((ref) => 'Hello world');
```

**Don't**:

```dart
class Example {
  // Unsupported operation. Could cause memory leaks and unexpected behaviors.
  final provider = Provider<String>((ref) => 'Hello world');
}
```

:::info
Creating providers as static final variables is allowed,
but not supported by the code-generator.

title: Your first Riverpod app
version: 2

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import { AutoSnippet } from "/src/components/CodeSnippet";
import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";
import { DartPad } from "/src/components/DartPad";

In this tutorial, we will build a random joke generator app using Riverpod:

<DartPad id="6bf918e3fc97a40b53d1ea80fd937146" />

## Key points
- Learn to install Riverpod
- Create your first provider to make a network request
- Use [Consumer] to display the data
- Handle [AsyncValue] to display loading and error states

## Setting up the project

### Creating a Flutter project

To start, let's create a new Flutter project:

```sh
flutter create first_app
```

Then, open the project in your favorite editor.

### Creating a mocked UI

Before we start to write any form of logic, let's create the UI of our app.
Instead of using a real API, we will start with static data.

Let's create a new file called `home.dart` in the `lib` directory of our project.
In it, you can paste the following code:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/home.dart"
  raw={`
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  
  class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
    const HomeView({super.key});
  
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Random Joke Generator')),
        body: SizedBox.expand(
          child: Stack(
            alignment: Alignment.center,
            children: [
              const SelectableText(
                'What kind of bagel can fly?\\n\\n'
                'A plain bagel.',
                textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
              ),
  
              Positioned(
                bottom: 20,
                child: ElevatedButton(
                  onPressed: () {},
                  child: const Text('Get another joke'),
                ),
              ),
            ],
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
`}
/>

Then, we can update our `main.dart` file to use this new `HomeView` widget:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/main.dart"
  raw={`
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  
  import 'home.dart';
  
  void main() {
    runApp(const MyApp());
  }
  
  class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
    const MyApp({super.key});
  
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return const MaterialApp(home: HomeView());
    }
  }
`}
/>

If you run the app now, you should see the following:

![Mocked UI](/img/tutorials/first_app/mocked_ui.png)

### Adding Riverpod to the project

After creating the project, we need to add Riverpod as a dependency.

We will be using Riverpod and Flutter, so we will install the [flutter_riverpod] package.  
Similarly, we will be performing network requests using the [Dio] package, so we will install that as well.

You can do so by typing the following command in your terminal:

```sh
flutter pub add flutter_riverpod dio
```

This will add the latest version of Riverpod to your project, along with Dio.

### (Optional) Adding riverpod_lint

To help you write better Riverpod code, you can install the [riverpod_lint] package.  
This package provides a set of refactors to more easily write Riverpod code, as well as a set of lints to help you avoid common mistakes.

Riverpod_lint is implemented using [analysis_server_plugin]. As such, it is installed through `analysis_options.yaml`

Long story short, create an `analysis_options.yaml` next to your `pubspec.yaml` and add:

```yaml title="analysis_options.yaml"
plugins:
  riverpod_lint: <latest version from https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_lint>
```

### Adding ProviderScope in our main function

For Riverpod to work, we need to update our `main` function to include a [ProviderScope].  
You can learn about those objects in the <Link documentID="concepts2/containers" /> section.

Here's the updated `main` function:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/main.dart"
  raw={`
void main() {
  runApp(
    // Add ProviderScope above your app
    // highlight-next-line
    const ProviderScope(
      child: MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
  `}
/>

## Creating a model class

In this tutorial, we will fetch data from a [Random Joke generator](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke) API.

This API returns a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "type": "general",
  "setup": "Why did the scarecrow win an award?",
  "punchline": "Because he was outstanding in his field.",
  "id": 333
}
```

To represent this data in our app, we will create a model class called `Joke`.  

For this, let's create a new file called `joke.dart` in the `lib` directory of our project.
Here's how the `Joke` class looks like:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/joke.dart"
  raw={`
class Joke {
  Joke({
    required this.type,
    required this.setup,
    required this.punchline,
    required this.id,
  });
  
  factory Joke.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json) {
    return Joke(
      type: json['type']! as String,
      setup: json['setup']! as String,
      punchline: json['punchline']! as String,
      id: json['id']! as int,
    );
  }
  
  final String type;
  final String setup;
  final String punchline;
  final int id;
}
  `}
/>


Notice the `fromJson` factory constructor.  
Since our API returns a JSON object, we need a way to convert JSON data into our `Joke` class.
This constructor takes a `Map<String, Object?>` and returns a `Joke` instance.

## Writing a function that calls the API.

Now that we have our model class, we can write a function that fetches the data from the API.
We will use the [Dio] package here, because it naturally throws if a request fails, which is convenient for our use case.
But you can use any HTTP client you prefer.

We can place that logic in the `joke.dart` file we just created,
as this logic is closely related to the `Joke` class.

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/joke.dart"
  raw={`
  final dio = Dio();
  
  Future<Joke> fetchRandomJoke() async {
    // Fetching a random joke from a public API
    final response = await dio.get<Map<String, Object?>>(
      'https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke',
    );
  
    return Joke.fromJson(response.data!);
  }
  `}
/>

:::info
Notice how we did not catch any error from the API call.  
This is on purpose. Riverpod will handle errors for us, so we don't need to do it manually.
:::

## Creating a provider that fetches the data

Now that we have a function to query the API, we can create a "provider" responsible for
caching the result of that API.  
See <Link documentID="concepts2/providers" /> for more information about them.

Since our `fetchRandomJoke` function returns a `Future<Joke>`, we will use [FutureProvider].
We can place the provider in the same `joke.dart` file, as it is also related to the `Joke` class.

By doing this, the execution of `fetchRandomJoke` will be cached, and regardless of how
many times we access to the value, the network request will only be performed once.

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/joke.dart"
  raw={`
  final randomJokeProvider = FutureProvider<Joke>((ref) async {
    // Using the fetchRandomJoke function to get a random joke
    return fetchRandomJoke();
  });
  `}
/>

:::info
The separation between our `fetchRandomJoke` function and the `randomJokeProvider` is not mandatory.  
You can directly write the content of `fetchRandomJoke` inside the provider if you prefer:

```dart
final randomJokeProvider = FutureProvider<Joke>((ref) async {
  final response = await dio.get<Map<String, Object?>>(
    'https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke',
  );

  return Joke.fromJson(response.data!);
});
```
:::

## Displaying the data in the UI

### Wrapping our UI in a Consumer

Now that we have a provider, it is time to update our `HomeView` widget to dynamically load data.

To do so, we will need another feature of Riverpod: the [Consumer] widget.  
This widget allows us to read the value of a provider and rebuild the UI when the value changes.
It is used in a manner that is reminiscent of widgets such like [StreamBuilder].

Specifically, we will want to encapsulate the `Stack` in a `Consumer` widget.  
If you have installed [riverpod_lint] in the earlier step, you can use one of the built-in refactors:

![Wrap in Consumer refactor in action](/img/tutorials/first_app/wrap_in_consumer.gif)

The updated `home.dart` code should look like this:

<AutoSnippet
  title="lib/home.dart"
  raw={`
  import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
  import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';
  
  class HomeView extends StatelessWidget {
    const HomeView({super.key});
  
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(title: const Text('Random Joke Generator')),
        body: SizedBox.expand(
          // highlight-next-line
          child: Consumer(
            // highlight-next-line
            builder: (context, ref, child) {
              return Stack(
                alignment: Alignment.center,
                children: [
                  const SelectableText(
                    'What kind of bagel can fly?\\n\\n'
                    'A plain bagel.',
                    textAlign: TextAlign.center,
                    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
                  ),
  
                  Positioned(
                    bottom: 20,
                    child: ElevatedButton(
                      onPressed: () {},
                      child: const Text('Get another joke'),
                    ),
                  ),
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      );
    }
  }
  `}
/>

### Obtaining our joke and listening to its changes

Now that we have a `Consumer`, we can use its `ref` parameter to read our provider.  
Using this object, we can call `ref.watch(randomJokeProvider)` to obtain the current value of the provider.
But there are other ways to interact with providers! See <Link documentID="concepts2/refs" /> for more information.

Our updated `Consumer` should look like this:

```dart
Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    // highlight-next-line
    final randomJoke = ref.watch(randomJokeProvider);
    // ...
  },
)
```

With this line, Riverpod will automatically fetch the joke from our API and cache the result.
We can now use the `randomJoke` variable to display the joke in our UI.

### Handling loading and error states

The `randomJoke` variable we created earlier is not of type `Joke`, but rather of type `AsyncValue<Joke>`.  
[AsyncValue] is a Riverpod type that represents the state of an asynchronous operation, such as a network request.
It includes information about loading, success, and error states. `AsyncValue` is in many ways similar to the `AsyncSnapshot` type used in [StreamBuilder].

A convenient way to handle the different states is to use Dart's `switch` feature. It is similar to an
`if`/`else if` chain, but tailored for handling conditions on one specific object.

A common way to use it when combined with `AsyncValue` is as follows:

```dart
switch (asyncValue) {
  // If "value" is non-null, it means that we have some data.
  case AsyncValue(:final value?):
    return Text(value);
  // If "error" is non-null, it means that the operation failed.
  case AsyncValue(error: != null):
    return Text('Error: ${asyncValue.error}');
  // If we're neither in data state nor in error state, then we're in loading state.
  case AsyncValue():
    return const CircularProgressIndicator();
}
```

:::caution
The order of operation matters!  
If using the syntax used above, it is important to check for values 
_before_ checking for errors and to handle the loading state last.

If using a different order, you may see incorrect behavior, such as
showing a progress indicator when the request has already completed.
:::


We can now update our `Stack` to display the joke, loading indicator, or error message based on the state of `randomJoke`:

<AutoSnippet
  raw={`
  return Stack(
    alignment: Alignment.center,
    children: [
      switch (randomJoke) {
        // When the request completes successfully, we display the joke.
        AsyncValue(:final value?) => SelectableText(
          '$\{value.setup}\\n\\n$\{value.punchline}',
          textAlign: TextAlign.center,
          style: const TextStyle(fontSize: 24),
        ),
        // On error, we display a simple error message.
        AsyncValue(error: != null) => const Text('Error fetching joke'),
        // While the request is loading, we display a progress indicator.
        AsyncValue() => const CircularProgressIndicator(),
      },
  
      // <code for the button remains unchanged>
    ],
  );
`}
/>


At this stage, our application is connected to internet and a random joke is displayed when the app is launched!

### Connecting the "Get another joke" button

Currently, we display a random joke when the app is launched, but clicking on the
button does nothing. Let's update the button to fetch a new joke when clicked.

We _could_ use a pattern similar to [ChangeNotifier] and manually handle the state.  
Riverpod supports such patterns, but it is not necessary here.

Instead, we can tell Riverpod to re-execute the logic of our provider when the button is clicked.
This can be done by using [Ref.invalidate] like so:

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  // highlight-next-line
  onPressed: () => ref.invalidate(randomJokeProvider),
  child: const Text('Get another joke'),
),
```

That is all we need to do!  
When the button is clicked, Riverpod will re-execute the logic of `randomJokeProvider`, which will
fetch a new joke from the API and update the UI accordingly.

### Adding a `LinearProgressIndicator` when a new joke is being fetched

You may have noticed that when clicking on the "Get another joke" button, the app does not show any loading indicator.

This is because when we call [Ref.invalidate], the existing cache is not destroyed.
Instead, while the new joke is being fetched, we retain information about the previous joke.
This allows us to display the previous joke while the new one is being fetched.

However, UIs may want to handle those cases and show both a loading indicator and the previous joke.
A [LinearProgressIndicator] is a common way to do so. To add this indicator, we can check
[AsyncValue.isRefreshing]. This flag is `true` when old data is available and a new request is being made.

Our updated `Stack` should look like this:

```dart
return Stack(
  alignment: Alignment.center,
  children: [
    // During the second request, we show a special loading indicator
    // highlight-next-line
    if (randomJoke.isRefreshing)
      const Positioned(
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        right: 0,
        child: LinearProgressIndicator(),
      ),

    // Show the data and button like before
  ],
);
```

That's all!  
We now have a fully functional random joke generator app that fetches jokes from an API and displays them in the UI.  
And we have handled all edge-cases, such as loading and error states.

Notice how we never had to write a `try/catch` or write code such as `isLoading = true/false`.

Along with [Riverpod 2.0](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod/changelog#200), new classes
were introduced: `Notifier` / `AsyncNotifier`.
`StateNotifier` is now discouraged in favor of those new APIs.

This page shows how to migrate from the deprecated `StateNotifier` to the new APIs.

The main benefit introduced by `AsyncNotifier` is a better `async` support; indeed,
`AsyncNotifier` can be thought as a `FutureProvider` which can expose ways to be modified from the UI.

Furthermore, the new `(Async)Notifier`s:

- Expose a `Ref` object inside its class
- Offer similar syntax between codegen and non-codegen approaches
- Offer similar syntax between their sync and async versions
- Move away logic from Providers and centralize it into the Notifiers themselves

Let's see how to define a `Notifier`, how it compares with `StateNotifier` and how to migrate
the new `AsyncNotifier` for asynchronous state.

## New syntax comparison

Be sure to know how to define a `Notifier` before diving into this comparison.
See <Link documentID="concepts2/providers" />.

Let's write an example, using the old `StateNotifier` syntax:

> **Snippet: build_init_old.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/legacy.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class CounterNotifier extends StateNotifier<int> {
  CounterNotifier() : super(0);

  void increment() => state++;
  void decrement() => state--;
}

final counterNotifierProvider =
    StateNotifierProvider<CounterNotifier, int>((ref) {
  return CounterNotifier();
});

```


Here's the same example, built with the new `Notifier` APIs, which roughly translates to:

> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/flutter_riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class CounterNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() => 0;

  void increment() => state++;
  void decrement() => state++;
}

final counterNotifierProvider = NotifierProvider<CounterNotifier, int>(CounterNotifier.new);

```


Here's the above example, rewritten with the new `AsyncNotifier` APIs:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: avoid_unused_constructor_parameters

import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

class Todo {
  Todo.fromJson(Object obj);
}

class Http {
  Future<List<Object>> get(String str) async => [str];
}

final http = Http();

/* SNIPPET START */
class AsyncTodosNotifier extends AsyncNotifier<List<Todo>> {
  @override
  FutureOr<List<Todo>> build() async {
    final json = await http.get('api/todos');

    return [...json.map(Todo.fromJson)];
  }

  // ...
}

final asyncTodosNotifier =
    AsyncNotifierProvider<AsyncTodosNotifier, List<Todo>>(
  AsyncTodosNotifier.new,
);

```
.
:::tip
Migrating from `StateNotifier<AsyncValue<T>>` to a `AsyncNotifier<T>` boils down to:

- Putting initialization logic into `build`
- Removing any `catch`/`try` blocks in initialization or in side effects methods
- Remove any `AsyncValue.guard` from `build`, as it converts `Future`s into `AsyncValue`s
:::


### Advantages

After these few examples, let's now highlight the main advantages of `Notifier` and `AsyncNotifier`:
- The new syntax should feel way simpler and more readable, especially for asynchronous state
- New APIs are likely to have less boilerplate code in general
- Syntax is now unified, no matter the type of provider you're writing, enabling code generation
(see <Link documentID="concepts/about_code_generation" />)

Let's go further down and highlight more differences and similarities.

## Explicit `.family` and `.autoDispose` modifications

Another important difference is how families and auto dispose is handled with the new APIs.

Modifications are explicitly stated inside the class; any parameters are directly injected in the
`build` method, so that they're available to the initialization logic.  
This should bring better readability, more conciseness and overall less mistakes.

Take the following example, in which a `StateNotifierProvider.family` is being defined.

> **Snippet: family_and_dispose_old.dart**
```dart

import 'dart:math';

import 'package:flutter_riverpod/legacy.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

import '../utils.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class BugsEncounteredNotifier extends StateNotifier<AsyncValue<int>> {
  BugsEncounteredNotifier({
    required this.ref,
    required this.featureId,
  }) : super(const AsyncData(99));
  final String featureId;
  final Ref ref;

  Future<void> fix(int amount) async {
    state = await AsyncValue.guard(() async {
      final old = state.requireValue;
      final result =
          await ref.read(taskTrackerProvider).fix(id: featureId, fixed: amount);
      return max(old - result, 0);
    });
  }
}

final bugsEncounteredNotifierProvider = StateNotifierProvider.family
    .autoDispose<BugsEncounteredNotifier, AsyncValue<int>, String>((ref, id) {
  return BugsEncounteredNotifier(ref: ref, featureId: id);
});

```


`BugsEncounteredNotifier` feels... heavy / hard to read.  
Let's take a look at its migrated `AsyncNotifier` counterpart:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unnecessary_this

import 'dart:math';

import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

import '../../utils.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class BugsEncounteredNotifier extends AsyncNotifier<int> {
  BugsEncounteredNotifier(this.arg);
  final String arg;

  @override
  FutureOr<int> build() {
    return 99;
  }

  Future<void> fix(int amount) async {
    final old = await future;
    final result =
        await ref.read(taskTrackerProvider).fix(id: this.arg, fixed: amount);
    state = AsyncData(max(old - result, 0));
  }
}

final bugsEncounteredNotifierProvider = AsyncNotifierProvider.family
    .autoDispose<BugsEncounteredNotifier, int, String>(
  BugsEncounteredNotifier.new,
);

```


Here, if `durationProvider` updates, `MyNotifier` _disposes_: its instance is then re-instantiated
and its internal state is then re-initialized.  
Furthermore, unlike every other provider, the `dispose` callback is to be defined
in the class, separately.  
Finally, it is still possible to write `ref.onDispose` in its _provider_, showing once again how
sparse the logic can be with this API; potentially, the developer might have to look into eight (8!)
different places to understand this Notifier behavior!

These ambiguities are solved with `Riverpod 2.0`.

### Old `dispose` vs `ref.onDispose`
`StateNotifier`'s `dispose` method refers to the dispose event of the notifier itself, aka it's a
callback that gets called *before disposing of itself*.

`(Async)Notifier`s don't have this property, since *they don't get disposed of on rebuild*; only
their *internal state* is.  
In the new notifiers, dispose lifecycles are taken care of in only _one_ place, via `ref.onDispose`
(and others), just like any other provider.
This simplifies the API, and hopefully the DX, so that there is only _one_ place to look at to
understand lifecycle side-effects: its `build` method.

Shortly: to register a callback that fires before its *internal state* rebuilds, we can use
`ref.onDispose` like every other provider.

You can migrate the above snippet like so:


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

import '../../utils.dart';

final repositoryProvider = Provider<_MyRepo>((ref) {
  return _MyRepo();
});

class _MyRepo {
  Future<void> update(int i, {CancelToken? token}) async {}
}

/* SNIPPET START */
class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() {
    // {@template period}
    // Just read/write the code here, in one place
    // {@endtemplate}
    final period = ref.watch(durationProvider);
    final timer = Timer.periodic(period, (t) => update());
    ref.onDispose(timer.cancel);

    return 0;
  }

  Future<void> update() async {
    await ref.read(repositoryProvider).update(state + 1);
    // {@template update}
    // `mounted` is no more!
    state++; // This might throw.
    // {@endtemplate}
  }
}

final myNotifierProvider = NotifierProvider<MyNotifier, int>(MyNotifier.new);

```
).

Therefore, the above example migrates to the following:

> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

import '../../utils.dart';

final repositoryProvider = Provider<_MyRepo>((ref) {
  return _MyRepo();
});

class _MyRepo {
  Future<void> update(int i, {CancelToken? token}) async {}
}

/* SNIPPET START */
class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() {
    // {@template period}
    // Just read/write the code here, in one place
    // {@endtemplate}
    final period = ref.watch(durationProvider);
    final timer = Timer.periodic(period, (t) => update());
    ref.onDispose(timer.cancel);

    return 0;
  }

  Future<void> update() async {
    final cancelToken = CancelToken();
    ref.onDispose(cancelToken.cancel);
    await ref.read(repositoryProvider).update(state + 1, token: cancelToken);
    state++;
  }
}

final myNotifierProvider = NotifierProvider<MyNotifier, int>(MyNotifier.new);

```


Becomes this:

> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() {
    listenSelf((_, next) => debugPrint('$next'));
    return 0;
  }

  void add() => state++;
}

final myNotifierProvider = NotifierProvider<MyNotifier, int>(MyNotifier.new);

```
.

### From `.debugState` in tests

`StateNotifier` exposes `.debugState`: this property is used for pkg:state_notifier users to enable
state access from outside the class when in development mode, for testing purposes.

If you're using `.debugState` to access state in tests, chances are that you need to drop this
approach.

`Notifier` / `AsyncNotifier` don't have a `.debugState`; instead, they directly expose `.state`,
which is `@visibleForTesting`.

:::danger
AVOID accessing `.state` from tests; if you have to, do it _if and only if_ you had already have
a `Notifier` / `AsyncNotifier` properly instantiated;
then, you could access `.state` inside tests freely.

Indeed, `Notifier` / `AsyncNotifier` _should not_ be instantiated by hand; instead, they should be
interacted with by using its provider: failing to do so will *break* the notifier,
due to ref and family args not being initialized.
:::

Don't have a `Notifier` instance?  
No problem, you can obtain one with `ref.read`, just like you would read its exposed state:


> **Snippet: obtain_notifier_on_tests.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: unused_local_variable,omit_local_variable_types

import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:hooks_riverpod/hooks_riverpod.dart';

class MyNotifier extends Notifier<int> {
  @override
  int build() {
    return 0;
  }
}

final myNotifierProvider =
    NotifierProvider.autoDispose<MyNotifier, int>(MyNotifier.new);

/* SNIPPET START */
void main(List<String> args) {
  test('my test', () {
    final container = ProviderContainer();
    addTearDown(container.dispose);

    // {@template notifier}
    // Obtaining a notifier
    // {@endtemplate}
    /* highlight-start */
    final Notifier<int> notifier = container.read(myNotifierProvider.notifier);
    /* highlight-end */

    // {@template state}
    // Obtaining its exposed state
    // {@endtemplate}
    /* highlight-start */
    final int state = container.read(myNotifierProvider);
    /* highlight-end */

    // {@template test}
    // TODO write your tests
    // {@endtemplate}
  });
}

```


Learn more about testing in its dedicated guide. See <Link documentID="how_to/testing" />.

### From `StateProvider`  

`StateProvider` was exposed by Riverpod since its release, and it was made to save a few LoC for
simplified versions of `StateNotifierProvider`.  
Since `StateNotifierProvider` is deprecated, `StateProvider` is to be avoided, too.  
Furthermore, as of now, there is no `StateProvider` equivalent for the new APIs.

Nonetheless, migrating from `StateProvider` to `Notifier` is simple.

This:

> **Snippet: from_state_provider_old.dart**
```dart
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/legacy.dart';

/* SNIPPET START */
final counterProvider = StateProvider<int>((ref) {
  return 0;
});

```


Becomes:
<AutoSnippet language="dart" {...fromStateProvider}></AutoSnippet>

Even though it costs us a few more LoC, migrating away from `StateProvider` enables us to
archive `StateNotifier`.

import old from "!!raw-loader!./from_change_notifier/old.dart";
import declaration from "./from_change_notifier/declaration";

import migrated from "./from_change_notifier/migrated";

Within Riverpod, `ChangeNotifierProvider` is meant to be used to offer a smooth transition from
pkg:provider.

If you've just started a migration to pkg:riverpod, make sure you read the dedicated guide
(see <Link documentID="from_provider/quickstart" />).
This article is meant for folks that already transitioned to riverpod, but want to move away from
`ChangeNotifier`.

All in all, migrating from `ChangeNotifier` to `AsyncNotifier` requires a
paradigm shift, but it brings great simplification with the resulting migrated
code.

Take this (faulty) example:

> **Snippet: old.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: avoid_unused_constructor_parameters

import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter_riverpod/legacy.dart';

class Todo {
  const Todo(this.id);
  Todo.fromJson(Object obj) : id = 0;

  final int id;
}

class Http {
  Future<List<Object>> get(String str) async => [str];
  Future<List<Object>> post(String str) async => [str];
}

final http = Http();

/* SNIPPET START */
class MyChangeNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  MyChangeNotifier() {
    _init();
  }
  List<Todo> todos = [];
  bool isLoading = true;
  bool hasError = false;

  Future<void> _init() async {
    try {
      final json = await http.get('api/todos');
      todos = [...json.map(Todo.fromJson)];
    } on Exception {
      hasError = true;
    } finally {
      isLoading = false;
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }

  Future<void> addTodo(int id) async {
    isLoading = true;
    notifyListeners();

    try {
      final json = await http.post('api/todos');
      todos = [...json.map(Todo.fromJson)];
      hasError = false;
    } on Exception {
      hasError = true;
    } finally {
      isLoading = false;
      notifyListeners();
    }
  }
}

final myChangeProvider = ChangeNotifierProvider<MyChangeNotifier>((ref) {
  return MyChangeNotifier();
});

```


This implementation shows several weak design choices such as:
- The usage of `isLoading` and `hasError` to handle different asynchronous cases
- The need to carefully handle requests with tedious `try`/`catch`/`finally` expressions
- The need to invoke `notifyListeners` at the right times to make this implementation work
- The presence of inconsistent or possibly undesirable states, e.g. initialization with an empty list

Note how this example has been crafted to show how `ChangeNotifier` can lead to faulty design choices
for newbie developers; also, another takeaway is that mutable state might be way harder than it
initially promises.

`Notifier`/`AsyncNotifier`, in combination with immutable state, can lead to better design choices
and less errors.

Let's see how to migrate the above snippet, one step at a time, towards the newest APIs.


## Start your migration
First, we should declare the new provider / notifier: this requires some thought process which
depends on your unique business logic.

Let's summarize the above requirements:
- State is represented with `List<Todo>`, which obtained via a network call, with no parameters
- State should *also* expose info about its `loading`, `error` and `data` state
- State can be mutated via some exposed methods, thus a function isn't enough

:::tip
The above thought process boils down to answering the following questions:
1. Are some side effects required?
    - `y`: Use riverpod's class-based API
    - `n`: Use riverpod's function-based API
2. Does state need to be loaded asynchronously?
    - `y`: Let `build` return a `Future<T>`
    - `n`: Let `build` simply return `T`
3. Are some parameters required?
    - `y`: Let `build` (or your function) accept them
    - `n`: Let `build` (or your function) accept no extra parameters
:::

:::info
If you're using codegen, the above thought process is enough.  
There's no need to think about the right class names and their *specific* APIs.  
`@riverpod` only asks you to write a class with its return type, and you're good to go.
:::

Technically, the best fit here is to define a `AsyncNotifier<List<Todo>>`,
which meets all the above requirements. Let's write some pseudocode first.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: avoid_unused_constructor_parameters

import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

class Todo {
  const Todo(this.id);
  Todo.fromJson(Object obj) : id = 0;

  final int id;
}

class Http {
  Future<List<Object>> get(String str) async => [str];
  Future<List<Object>> post(String str) async => [str];
}

final http = Http();

/* SNIPPET START */
class MyNotifier extends AsyncNotifier<List<Todo>> {
  @override
  FutureOr<List<Todo>> build() {
    // TODO ...
    return [];
  }

  Future<void> addTodo(Todo todo) async {
    // TODO
  }
}

final myNotifierProvider =
    AsyncNotifierProvider.autoDispose<MyNotifier, List<Todo>>(MyNotifier.new);

```
.
:::

With respect with `ChangeNotifier`'s implementation, we don't need to declare `todos` anymore;
such variable is `state`, which is implicitly loaded with `build`.

Indeed, riverpod's notifiers can expose *one* entity at a time.

:::tip
Riverpod's API is meant to be granular; nonetheless, when migrating, you can still define a custom
entity to hold multiple values. Consider using [Dart 3's records](https://dart.dev/language/records)
to smooth out the migration at first.
:::


### Initialization
Initializing a notifier is easy: just write initialization logic inside `build`.
We can now get rid of the old `_init` function.


> **Snippet: raw.dart**
```dart
// ignore_for_file: avoid_unused_constructor_parameters

import 'package:riverpod/riverpod.dart';
import 'package:riverpod_annotation/riverpod_annotation.dart';

class Todo {
  const Todo(this.id);
  Todo.fromJson(Object obj) : id = 0;

  final int id;
}

class Http {
  Future<List<Object>> get(String str) async => [str];
  Future<List<Object>> post(String str) async => [str];
}

final http = Http();

/* SNIPPET START */
class MyNotifier extends AsyncNotifier<List<Todo>> {
  @override
  FutureOr<List<Todo>> build() async {
    final json = await http.get('api/todos');
    return [...json.map(Todo.fromJson)];
  }
}

final myNotifierProvider =
    AsyncNotifierProvider.autoDispose<MyNotifier, List<Todo>>(MyNotifier.new);

```


:::tip
Syntax and design choices may vary, but in the end we just need to write our request and update
state afterwards. See <Link documentID="concepts2/providers" />.
:::

## Migration Process Summary

Let's review the whole migration process applied above, from a operational point of view.

1. We've moved the initialization, away from a custom method invoked in a constructor, to `build`
2. We've removed `todos`, `isLoading` and `hasError` properties: internal `state` will suffice
3. We've removed any `try`-`catch`-`finally` blocks: returning the future is enough
4. We've applied the same simplification on the side effects (`addTodo`)
5. We've applied the mutations, via simply reassign `state`

version: 2

import { Link } from "/src/components/Link";


After a long wait, the first stable version of Riverpod is finally released 👏

To see the full list of changes, consult the [Changelog](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_riverpod/changelog#100).  
In this page, we will focus on how to migrate an existing Riverpod application
from version 0.14.x to version 1.0.0.

## Using the migration tool to automatically upgrade your project to the new syntax

Before explaining the various changes, it is worth noting that Riverpod comes with
a command-line tool to automatically migrate your project for you.

### Installing the command line tool

To install the migration tool, run:

```sh
dart pub global activate riverpod_cli
```

You should now be able to run:

```sh
riverpod --help
```

### Usage

Now that the command line is installed, we can start using it.

- First, open the project you want to migrate in your terminal.
- **Do not** upgrade Riverpod.  
  The migration tool will upgrade the version of Riverpod for you.

  :::danger
  Not upgrading Riverpod is important.  
  The tool will not execute properly if you have already installed version 1.0.0.
  As such, make sure that you are properly using an older version before starting the tool.
  :::

- Make sure that your project does not contain errors.
- Execute:
  ```sh
  riverpod migrate
  ```

The tool will then analyze your project and suggest changes. For example you may see:

```diff
-Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
+Widget build(BuildContext context, Widget ref) {
-  MyModel state = watch(provider);
+  MyModel state = ref.watch(provider);
}

Accept change (y = yes, n = no [default], A = yes to all, q = quit)?
```

To accept the change, simply press <kbd>y</kbd>. Otherwise to reject it, press <kbd>n</kbd>.

## The changes

Now that we've seen how to use the CLI to automatically upgrade your project,
let's see in detail the changes necessary.

### Syntax unification

Version 1.0.0 of Riverpod focused on the unification of the syntax for
interacting with providers.  
Before, Riverpod had many similar yet different syntaxes for reading a provider,
such as `ref.watch(provider)` vs `useProvider(provider)` vs `watch(provider)`.  
With version 1.0.0, only one syntax remains: `ref.watch(provider)`. The
others were removed.

As such:

- `useProvider` is removed in favor of `HookConsumerWidget`.

  Before:

  ```dart
  class Example extends HookWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      useState(...);
      int count = useProvider(counterProvider);
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```dart
  class Example extends HookConsumerWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
      useState(...);
      int count = ref.watch(counterProvider);
      ...
    }
  }
  ```

- The prototype of `ConsumerWidget`'s `build` and `Consumer`'s `builder` changed.
 
  Before:

  ```dart
  class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
      int count = watch(counterProvider);
      ...
    }
  }

  Consumer(
    builder: (context, watch, child) {
      int count = watch(counterProvider);
      ...
    }
  )
  ```

  After:

  ```dart
  class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
      int count = ref.watch(counterProvider);
      ...
    }
  }

  Consumer(
    builder: (context, ref, child) {
      int count = ref.watch(counterProvider);
      ...
    }
  )
  ```

- `context.read` is removed in favor of `ref.read`.

  Before:

  ```dart
  class Example extends StatelessWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
      SomeButton(
        onPressed: () => context.read(provider.notifier).doSomething(),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```dart
  class Example extends ConsumerWidget {
    @override
    Widget build(BuildContext context, WidgetRef ref) {
      SomeButton(
        onPressed: () => ref.read(provider.notifier).doSomething(),
      );
    }
  }
  ```

### StateProvider update

[StateProvider] was updated to match [StateNotifierProvider].

Before, doing `ref.watch(StateProvider)` returned a `StateController` instance.
Now it only returns the state of the `StateController`.

To migrate you have a few solutions.  
If your code only obtained the state without modifying it, you can change from:

```dart
final provider = StateProvider<int>(...);

Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    StateController<int> count = ref.watch(provider);

    return Text('${count.state}');
  }
)
```

to:

```dart
final provider = StateProvider<int>(...);

Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    int count = ref.watch(provider);

    return Text('${count}');
  }
)
```

Alternatively you can use the new `StateProvider.state` to keep the old behavior.

```dart
final provider = StateProvider<int>(...);

Consumer(
  builder: (context, ref, child) {
    StateController<int> count = ref.watch(provider.state);

    return Text('${count.state}');
  }
)
```

FILE: migration/0.13.0_to_0.14.0.mdx
==================================================

---
title: ^0.13.0 to ^0.14.0
version: 2
---

With the release of version `0.14.0` of Riverpod, the syntax for using [StateNotifierProvider] changed
(see https://github.com/rrousselGit/riverpod/issues/341 for the explanation).

For the entire article, consider the following [StateNotifier]:

```dart
class MyModel {}

class MyStateNotifier extends StateNotifier<MyModel> {
  MyStateNotifier(): super(MyModel());
}
```

## The changes

- [StateNotifierProvider] takes an extra generic parameter, which should be
  the type of the state of your [StateNotifier].

  Before:

  ```dart
  final provider = StateNotifierProvider<MyStateNotifier>((ref) {
    return MyStateNotifier();
  });
  ```

  After:

  ```dart
  final provider = StateNotifierProvider<MyStateNotifier, MyModel>((ref) {
    return MyStateNotifier();
  });
  ```

- to obtain the [StateNotifier], you should now read `myProvider.notifier` instead of just `myProvider`:

  Before:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    MyStateNotifier notifier = watch(provider);
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    MyStateNotifier notifier = watch(provider.notifier);
  }
  ```

- to listen to the state of the [StateNotifier], you should now read `myProvider` instead of `myProvider.state`:

  Before:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    MyModel state = watch(provider.state);
  }
  ```

  After:

  ```dart
  Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
    MyModel state = watch(provider);
  }
  ```

## Using the migration tool to automatically upgrade your projects to the new syntax

With version 0.14.0 came the release of a command line tool for Riverpod,
which can help you migrate your projects.

### Installing the command line

To install the migration tool, run:

```sh
dart pub global activate riverpod_cli
```

You should now be able to run:

```sh
riverpod --help
```

### Usage

Now that the command line is installed, we can start using it.

- First, open the project you want to migrate in your terminal.
- **Do not** upgrade Riverpod.  
  The migration tool will upgrade the version of Riverpod for you.
- Make sure that your project does not contain errors.
- Execute:
  ```sh
  riverpod migrate
  ```

The tool will then analyze your project and suggest changes. For example you may see:

```diff
Widget build(BuildContext context, ScopedReader watch) {
-  MyModel state = watch(provider.state);
+  MyModel state = watch(provider);
}

Accept change (y = yes, n = no [default], A = yes to all, q = quit)? 
```

To accept the change, simply press <kbd>y</kbd>. Otherwise to reject it, press <kbd>n</kbd>.
